After pouring a few more hours into this game, I'm starting to get a clearer picture of what it is.

<!-- more -->

The primary focus seems to be commentary- satirizing common game tropes. Except said commentary isn't particularly well done. Characters complaining about what the player has to do may be humorous to some, but for me it comes off as a bit odd that a game is criticizing other games by mirroring them exactly. I'd be more likely to appreciate the commentary if they actually did something with those tropes besides being self aware that they've included them. For example, Zero complains that platform jumping is stupid. Then you do a lot of platform jumping for the rest of the level. That's not satire. Now, if Zero called her dragon over and you could just fly past the platform jumping parts (seriously why did this not happen), insisting that it would be meaningless and stupid and she has a less irritable form of transportation... that's satire.

There's also probably something relating to the excessive fowl language and self censoring- I'm not smart enough to pick up on what's being made fun of here though. Games that have protagonists who speak in nothing but fowl language one liners? It just comes off as annoying 80% of the time (this game is the answer to the question "what is a 14 year old male's idea of edgy?"), but the censoring is funny at least. 

The only thing I'm really appreciating with the commentary is reversal of gender roles. You kill your sisters, abduct their men and effectively make them your sex slaves. They all like it too, which is really the clincher. This aspect is really well done and uses proper satire- nothing criticizes quite like turning the subject matter inside out.

I still don't have any clearer picture of the story itself. I want to find out more, but I find myself tolerating the technical flaws of the game less and less. It's very visually cluttered, the framerate takes every opportunity to plunge, and the combat is sticky. It's the type of system where you can't just press X to jump, you have to complete whatever maneuver you were doing before you'll jump. So button mashing is punished, and I guess the idea is you have make sure there's time to actually finish whichever of the three combos you want to use, or you're a sitting duck for what seems like an absurd length of time. This would be fine if not for the terrible framerate, visual clutter, poor camera in cramped places, finicky targeting system, etc, etc. I have no problems with games that expect precision- but in order for such a game to work the system itself needs to be polished to the same level of perfections that is expected of the players.

The targeting system is OK- but it turns off when you kill the enemy you're targeting, which DOES NOT FLOW at all. You heavily rely on it when fighting clusters of enemies, and you'll inevitably be facing the wrong way when the targeting system turns off and get stabbed in the back as you slash at empty air. Here's an idea! How about when we press the button to turn targeting on, IT STAYS ON?! Since you use the right joystick to select targets, you don't touch it when target mode is on, and the abrupt return of manual camera control to a joystick you've trained yourself to not touch is bad design. Otherwise, I really like it. I also really like how the weapon switching system doesn't interrupt game flow (you can still run around).

The story so far plays out like the Star Trek alternate universe evil twin scenario. You're hell bent on killing your sisters, they have no idea why and they seem to remember you being an innocent lovely flower. The player is as clueless as the sisters in terms of your motivation. If this game ends with her motivation just being "because she felt like it"...

Finished branch A, and the story has not advanced one inch... so aside from the terrible execution of the story setting and the fact that the story is literally just non existent after, how many hours did I put into this by now? I can't yet judge the story until I complete the other branches. That is, assuming story happens in the other branches.

But I'm ready to form an opinion on the gameplay- it's less than average, worse than mediocre- pretty damn bad. There are a few really good ideas; the weapon changing thing, different weapons have different attacks and there are different styles of weaponry, the 'intoner mode' is really awesome and intelligently rationed. But all that is wasted on bad level design, sticky controls, limited number of attacks which become very repetitive, terrible camera control, a really poorly implemented and wonky targeting system, crappy enemy design and AI... and the visuals are just so faulty for so many reasons (low framerate, bad camera, enemies are the same color as their surroundings, etc) that you can't see what the hell is happening and 'block' is effectively useless because you will never be able to tell if any given enemy is winding up for an attack in time to effect its use. For every enemy you see wind up, the dive mechanic is best used. When you can't dive because you're surrounded by enemies... well, you can hold the block button but you might as well take your chances with jumping out. Hell, half the time I couldn't tell what I was doing or what weapon I had out- the visual direction just did not lend itself to being informative in the heat of the moment. Didn't help that, like the rest of the game, laggy/sticky input caused issues where I would try to switch weapons, but I was too fast and the game missed my initial input. The 'stunned' time is wayyyyy too long, and no, enemies won't stun lock you or even attack you, so it's effectively just a 5 second delay in gameplay (note: I have since discovered the button that allows you to instantly recover). For 90% of the game, your dragon is a sprite in the sky and he does not help you in any way. Even on the rare occasion you can call him he usually just spits one or two fireballs and simply watches from there on.

The monsters that create shockwaves- the shockwaves appear about a second later than they should and travel unreasonably slowly... also the visual wave itself hurts you which just makes no sense at all (I'm aware this is common in other games). Not to mention loading times are biblical in proportion, even for just opening a damn door in front of you, it always triggers a cutscene (yes game I really want to watch a door open for 7 seconds) and it's always oddly delayed.

I'm calling _expletive deleted_ on the mechanics of you flying backwards for an entire fight with Gabriel. Just... what? Also, Gabriel had your entire dragon in his mouth at one point, but during the cathedral fight the two dragons are roughly the same size.

And the cathedral fight! Where do I begin!?

Developer1: What setting would be best for a boss fight in which there are two dragon riders going at it?

Developer2: I know! Inside a really tiny room with a lot of columns!

_facepalm_

Also I'm pretty sure the game slowed down because of frame rate issues so much that it effectively broke the fight with Gabriel. I managed to shoot enough fire down his throat twice to get him to fall over- but on subsequent replays the game slowed down so much and became unresponsive to the point where I couldn't get it to happen again.
