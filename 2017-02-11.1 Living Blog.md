Today I revised one of my older, more poorly written reviews. It occurs to me that "posts" on the internet are legitimately a form of historical record- they represent a past me, writing in a past context. Under certain circumstances, revising history could be seen as dishonest; going into a historical record to change things I have said is, in a sense, falsifying said historical record.

On the other hand, to readers, anything I have written is a reflection of me. Blog posts are not meant to be read like a linear book. I suspect most readers will stumble across individual posts, and that compartmentalized snippet of text is all they will see of me.

I want my blog to represent my ideas as they are. If I no longer hold a certain view, I will update the post to reflect my current thinking (if I remember to, anyway). If I feel I failed to clearly express myself in an older post, I will bring it up to my current standards.

Consider this blog a living document- each post is subject to change as my views and writing skills evolve. Sometimes I will append updates to the bottom of a post, other times I will rewrite it completely. That being said! I am tracking each post through git. The full history of any edits I make to any post will be recorded here: <https://github.com/Link-Satonaka/blog>. I hope those concerned will find this strategy agreeable.
