Behold: the conventional setup on most Windows devices.

Let's check out a popular site using a popular browser!

Cool dog. I'm going to save this picture.

Something isn't right. All the content on this website is presented as a narrow vertical feed, and yet my UI is obscuring a large portion of my monitor's vertical space. Meanwhile, off to the right there's just... nothing. This isn't just an isolated case with reddit- in fact I'd argue that most websites today are designed for a portrait oriented mobile device. Come to think of it, widescreen monitors haven't even been around that long: the internet has a long history of being viewed through the 4:3 aspect ratio. The better websites can dynamically adjust to make efficient use of given space, but the web arguably prefers the portrait experience and never fully embraced the widescreen ratios our monitors use today. Would it not make more sense for our UI elements to capitalize on that unused width? I think so.

I've been using this setup for several years now. This feels right. I can see more of the web page, and there's still enough unused horizontal space to display a wider picture of doggos. Downloads are neatly stowed in a popup box, as opposed to the chromium download bar (which must be manually dismissed!).

Moving these UI elements off to the side benefits not only the content of the web, but it's also a more functional layout of the UI itself. I've opened 30+ tabs in each configuration to demonstrate.

With the vertical arrangement of the tabbar, I can see more of the twitter front page, there's less blank space, and I can read the title of each tab I have open. The conventional arrangement, on the other hand, is clearly less functional. The tab bar is too compressed to display any useful information and twitter loses some content while gaining thicker margins. The same principle applies to the Windows taskbar: you can fit more running programs in the taskbar while still retaining readable window titles.

## Ups and Downs

It's almost universally true that we engage with the internet vertically. Websites scroll up and down, not side to side. Mice have vertical scrolling wheels. Keyboards have `PageUp`, `PageDown`, `Home` (jump to the top), and `End` (jump to the bottom). Clearly, we're used to operating around this fundamental truth. Then why, oh why, does conventional UI go out of its way to occupy that precious vertical space? If we engage with our content vertically, wouldn't it make sense to maximize the amount of vertical space available for use? What's more confounding about these design choices is that the wider our displays get, the more relatively scarce vertical space becomes, while the unused horizontal space is larger than ever.

Dynamically reflowing text isn't the answer to every aspect ratio: an old convention in the programming world is to limit the maximum width of a line to 80 characters. The thought that it's better to format text in narrower, physical page-like widths is echoed comically [here](http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/) and in the many ebook reading softwares which feature such configurations.
