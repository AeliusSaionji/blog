A “hard reset” is like reinstalling Windows. All existing data is wiped and the operating system is restored to a fresh state. If you’re having problems with your phone, a hard reset is likely going to solve it. The hard reset is a rather brute force solution, and unfortunately it is often the only course of action to take when experiencing issues. This guide will help you to not lose anything that could have been saved.

## Settings

Under “sync my settings” make sure the items you want synced are in fact enabled for syncing.

Under “backup” tap “text messages”. If you want text messages backed up, make sure that setting is enabled.

Under “backup” again, tap “apps+settings”, review what is enabled. If your last backup is more than 24 hours ago, you might want to create a manual backup by tapping “back up now”.

If you use Apps Corner or Kid’s Corner, open those up and take screenshots of the apps you’ve enabled there.

## Apps

I know of three apps that use the internal backup feature. You’re going to want to run through every app you have installed and make sure you take screenshots of or manually back up important information from each. Many apps offer to backup their settings to OneDrive.

## Cortana

Tap the hamburger menu, tap “remind me” and take a screenshot of any remaining reminders. These might be synced, but until someone verifies that they definitely are...

## Found Music

Open the Xbox Music app and look for the “recently found songs” button. Take a screenshot of that page. This is also found under Cortana, but not everyone has Cortana yet.

## Pins

Have you pinned any websites or other non-app items to your start screen? These might be backed up, but you’ll want to make a more permanent backup of these items.

## Media

Connect your phone to your PC and back up all pictures, videos, and music. Any items on an SD card will not be touched, but you might as well make the backup while you’re backing up everything else.

## Already Safe

The following things are tied to your Microsoft account and don’t need backing up: contacts, WiFi networks, Internet Explorer bookmarks. It’s possible that your contacts are not tied to your MS account- they might be tied to your SIM or who knows where. Log into your MS account from a PC on [this site](https://people.live.com/); if all of your contacts are here, they’re backed up with your MS account.

## Hard Reset

Ideally, make sure the battery has at least 50% charge before proceeding. Go to settings &gt; about, and press reset. Follow any on screen prompts. If your phone is not functioning well enough for you to get to this page, every phone can be reset by holding down a combination of buttons. For Nokia Lumia phones, that combination is:

1. Hold the Power and Volume Down buttons until the phone reboots (phone will vibrate to indicate a successful reboot).
2. Release the Power button (or else the phone will keep rebooting), but keep holding Volume Down.
3. If you have done it correctly, there will be an exclamation point on the screen. Enter the following button sequence: Volume Up, Volume Down, Power, Volume Down. If done correctly, gears will display on the screen- the phone is now resetting.

In my experience, the Windows Phone update process isn’t always perfect- I have many times seen forum posters reporting “buggy behavior” or “worse battery life” when updating to the latest release. This is always assumed to be a bug in the new release when in fact the problem is almost always a botched update (the Developer Preview in particular has gained a lot of negativity on the WindowsCentral forums due to this misconception). Do everyone a favor and hard reset before jumping to conclusions. However, a hard reset isn’t always enough. Sometimes, the files used to restore your phone during a hard reset are not in perfect order. At this point, you need to re-flash the ROM. This process is more involved, and your local cellular carrier shop should be able to do it for you. I will write a guide in the future for those who want to do it themselves.
