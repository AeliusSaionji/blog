MobileNations is a collection of sites for the different cell phone operating systems. I mostly participated in the WindowsCentral community; after spending a considerable amount of time there, I left the forums because... let’s just say I didn’t feel it was a productive use of my time.

I generally had no problem with the content of WindowsCentral as a news outlet, but I drifted away from that too because not a lot has been happening with WindowsPhone and most of the articles started targeting the lesser technically inclined with frequent “how to do [basic function of the phone]”.

Checked out an article recently and what do I find? They provide a URL that is implied to link to Microsoft, a trusted source. It actually sends you through [tradedoubler](http://www.tradedoubler.com/uk-en/about-tradedoubler/), an advertising agency.

In the attached picture I highlight the download link which purports to link to “the Windows Store”, and the red outline demonstrates where the link actually points. I would expect this behavior from the scummiest leeches of the internet “news” outlets. I guess it’s time to consider MobileNations to be one of those scummy “news” outlets. I actually have questions about the legality of this- is it not fraudulent? There is no indication that the link goes through an advertising agency, and most people won’t notice and the context is intentionally misleading. I’m sure MobileNations makes money from the redirect, and this is a breach of user privacy that I certainly did not consent to.

The article in question: <http://www.windowscentral.com/you-can-now-start-using-xbox-beta-windows-10>

**Update**: The site mspoweruser.com does this as well. I spoke with one of the editors of that site and learned tradedoubler in of itself is not bad; it's an "affiliate link", and it tells microsoft which news outlets are generating traffic, and I think MS pays the outlets proportionately from the data tradedoubler collects. I'm still firmly in the camp that this is scummy, lying behavior, though; all I ask is that they denote that this is an affiliate link. Posing this as a direct link to a trusted company is phishing.
