# A FAQ (of sorts) about fps, hz, latency, and persistence.

These are all things people have said to me over the years. This is a subject that interests me greatly, so I've thought quite a bit about most of these. I'm putting what I've learned into writing; maybe you'll find it informative.

Keep in mind, vision is a complicated process that is constructed by your brain. We do not operate like cameras. A decent sample of the complexity of vision can be found here <https://www.pcgamer.com/how-many-frames-per-second-can-the-human-eye-really-see/>.


> "Higher framerate only matters for fast paced shooter games, it doesn't benefit me because I play other kinds of games."
Lower latency is important for competitive play, and higher framerates reduce latency, but framerate in of itself is universally beneficial and arguably matters more for "slower" games.

> "I can't see the difference between 30 and 60, or 60 and 120"
Maybe use "slower" games rather than shooters when comparing.

> "120 was a huge bump over 60, but any higher is diminishing returns."
Anything over 120fps? Yeah probably. Over 120Hz on a sample&hold display? Without some form of blur reduction present, blur is a function of Hz. Higher Hz confers less blur. There will always be contexts where any amount of blur is quite noticeable.

> "Why did 30fps suddenly become a problem when it never used to be? There were plenty of 30fps games in the past and no one complained- in fact, Ocarina of Time was 20fps! Now that you have highfps, **you** just think anything less looks worse."
When viewer attention is fixed to center screen, there's less opportunity for ["persistence of vision"][1] blurring to occur. Thanks to a lack of analog camera control (and with Ocarina of Time in particular, the z targeting system) such old games hold up remarkably well on our modern sample&hold displays.
The chief problem is with "persistence of vision", something that largely wasn't a factor on CRTs. It's a new problem introduced by modern sample&hold displays. I'll say it again: _persistence_ is the problem, not framerate; after all, a 0fps static picture looks just fine on a sample&hold display.
A lowfps scene where the camera is static but has tiny objects moving within it is fairly inoffensive, because the blur is restricted to the tiny objects- and even then, only if your eye is actively tracking those objects. The object's size and speed and distance-traveled are all factors that influence how much blur we perceive. When the entire frame is in motion - such as when panning the camera - the entire frame will have blur. Clearly, the **extent to which this is a problem is contextual**. In a first person shooter the impact may not necessarily be dramatic; much of the "tracking" involves centering an object on-screen such that it is technically unmoving with respect to the display (not unlike Zelda's z-targeting). Tracking an object with the mouse/joystick instead of your eyes neatly sidesteps the problem.
More jarring contexts occur with a 3rd person camera which the player is allowed to freely pivot around the player character. Frequently the play of these games involve positioning the camera such that an object is visible, but not necessarily unmoving with respect to the display. Tracking an object with your eye while it moves within the frame, while the entire frame itself is also moving, creates blur upon blur that can be quite offensive to the eye.
Another context where heavy "persistence" occurs frequently with 2D indie games: any time the camera slowly pans across a static scene!

> "What makes CRTs so special?"
I want to underline that framerate is distinct from Hz is distinct from latency. And I want you to read [that blurbusters article][1].
With that out of the way, here's an analogy for camera nerds (this is strictly an _analogy_ that models the phenomena, but is overly simplifying CRT):
```
 LCD,OLED 60Hz : eyeballs :: 1/60   shutter speed : film
LCD,OLED 120Hz : eyeballs :: 1/120  shutter speed : film
      CRT 60Hz : eyeballs :: 1/1000 shutter speed : film
     CRT 120Hz : eyeballs :: 1/1000 shutter speed : film
```
This is why lowfps impacts our modern sample&hold displays more than CRT. Persistence has become a function of Hz, but only if there's a unique frame per Hz. 30fps on a 60Hz display has persistence functionally equivalent to 30Hz or a 1/30 shutter speed! To get the persistence equivalent to 1/60 shutter on a 60Hz display, we need to be pushing 60fps.
Stated from another angle: higher fps requires higher Hz to render, which inherently decreases the effect of persistence.
Note: if it wasn't clear by now, CRT is _not_ sample&hold.
Note2: if you're curious about plasma's effective "shutter speed", it sits notably slower than CRT, but notably faster than sample&hold. I can't be more specific because I've no idea how to quantify the complicated way in which plasma works into a simple number.
Note3: Blur reduction exists for sample&hold displays. The goal is, in effect, to "increase the shutter speed of the display" (quotes because this is strictly an analogy). Not all blur reduction implementations actually reach a 1/1000; perhaps manufacturers are afraid of buyers complaining about flicker, or the reduction in brightness.


> "30fps is fine because movies are shot in 24fps and they're fine!"
Benefits of lower latency aside, the problem with this argument is that it equates twiddling an analog stick with how a trained director chooses to frame a given scene, and how a trained camera crew follows a given shot. Movies are shot with careful intentionality, with awareness of the confines of the medium. Furthermore, a real world camera can capture temporal information beyond its framerate in the form of blur: simply adjust the shutter speed. By contrast, a videogame is typically rendering instantaneous moments in time, which by itself exacerbates the problem.
