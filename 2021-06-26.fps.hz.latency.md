"Higher framerate only matters for fast paced shooter games, it doesn't benefit me because I play other kinds of games."
Lower latency is important for competitive play, and higher framerates reduce latency, but framerate in of itself is universally beneficial and arguably matters more for "slower" games.

"I can't see the difference between 30 and 60, or 60 and 120"
Maybe use "slower" games rather than shooters when comparing.

"120 was a huge bump over 60, but any higher is diminishing returns."
Anything over 120fps? Yeah probably. Over 120Hz on a sample&hold display? Without some form of blur reduction present, blur is a function of Hz. Higher Hz confers less blur. There will always be contexts where any amount of blur is quite noticeable.

"30fps today is equivalent to 30fps games of the past- and Ocarina of Time was
20fps!"
When viewer attention is fixed to center screen, there's less opportunity for persistence of vision blur to occur. Thanks to a lack of analog camera control (and with Ocarina of Time in particular, the z targeting system) such old games hold up remarkably well on our modern sample and hold displays. But make no mistake, they were designed and released for CRT, and CRT simply do not create blur from persistence of vision. 30fps really only started being a problem for 3D games when modern displays came about.

"30fps is fine because movies are shot in 24fps and they're fine!"
Benefits of lower latency aside, the problem with this argument is that it equates twiddling an analog stick with how a trained director chooses to frame a given scene, and how a trained camera crew follows a given shot. Movies are shot with careful intentionality, with awareness of the confines of the medium. Furthermore, a real world camera can capture temporal information beyond its framerate in the form of blur: simply adjust the shutter speed. By contrast, a videogame is typically rendering instantaneous moments in time, which by itself exacerbates the problem.

framerate is distinct from Hz is distinct from latency.

 LCD,OLED 60Hz : eyeballs :: 1/60   shutter speed : film
LCD,OLED 120Hz : eyeballs :: 1/120  shutter speed : film
      CRT 60Hz : eyeballs :: 1/1000 shutter speed : film
     CRT 120Hz : eyeballs :: 1/1000 shutter speed : film
