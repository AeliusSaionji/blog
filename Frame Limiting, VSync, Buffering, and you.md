Just the first part of my research in vsync/framelimiting/etc. I'll edit this post later when I've finished collecting data. The reason I'm doing this is because any research I've done on the subject... I can't get a straight answer because no one online can agree on anything.

I'll conduct my own tests and post the facts here. The above picture is just demonstrating that resource usage is directly proportional to frames rendered, and frame limiting does in fact reduce resource usage.
