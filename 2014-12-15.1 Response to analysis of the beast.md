Searching the internet for more information on the turtles led me to your theory on the identity of the beast. I wanted to just send you a message, or comment on the post itself, or "ask a question" (whatever that button does) but tumblr is incredibly poorly equipped to do something as simple as the task of transferring text between two people. So it seems I must communicate with you by incredibly circuitous means and hope you see it... no I don't come here often.

I do like your theory- but ultimately I don't think it holds water. There are a number of things in your post I felt compelled to address.

1. There really isn't enough evidence in the show to support the (rather specific) claim that the turtles create a driving obsession to repeatedly perform the last task that was done prior to or at the time of eating a turtle. You completely ignored this aspect yourself when discussing Lorna- was she eating children on an average day when she accidentally slipped a turtle in her belly too? Moreover the show makes a very clear distinction between Lorna and the spirit within her-&nbsp;I see no reason to believe the turtles were responsible for the spirit possessing Lorna. As for your 'evil by proximity to turtles' idea, we don't even know for how long Lorna was living with Auntie Whispers; if I had to guess I'd say it seems to be a rather recent development. I don't think you can make this claim about the turtles with any certainty. I don't think you need to, the beast's relationship with the lantern is clearly one of self preservation. It doesn't really matter how that came about, and one doesn't need obsession to want survival.

2. The eating of the turtles does make a point to occur twice in visually memorable scenes, but there is nothing indicating that the beast is a product of the turtles. Equally possible: the turtles are a product of the beast. Or perhaps completely unrelated.

3. We have no reason to suspect Auntie Whispers has any sort of magic. She possesses bell that the spirit responds to, which doesn't inherently make the bell magical (although it glows, so it's probably magical), and she eats the turtles. It's important to note the turtle the dog "ate" was still alive when coughed up, and Auntie Whispers actually kills them. She has done nothing magical here.

4. You make a case for the beast not being very old- you go so far as to say it might only have existed for a few weeks. I don't think there is much support for this train of thought- the beast is referred to as if it were a living legend- it has it's own well known mythology, and the woodsman as lantern bearer is an event so recent that no one knows about it. It seems clear to me that the beast is an ancient figure. That being said, time doesn't seem to be consistent in the Unknown- the brothers' journey takes a few days at least, but when they leave the Unknown they arrive home moments after they left. While the meaning of this could be interpreted in a great number of ways, another point of note is that each character within the Unknown seems to be lost out of time. The woodsman's daughter might only have been missing for one day outside of the Unknown, but might have played the role of the beast for centuries before the woodsman arrived.

5. Several things wrong with the quotation below. Carrying the candle is not particularly significant or symbolic of a lantern. We don't know any other people the beast has turned into a tree, so we wouldn't know if they had reappeared or not. We don't know that the daughter was turned into a tree- it's entirely possible the daughter went missing, perhaps in the Unknown, where she may have encountered the beast. Maybe she manages to return home, but not before the woodsman went to look for her. The woodsman meets the beast, and is told the lie: his daughter was here, and perished; now her soul is within the lantern.
	> "She’s even carrying a candle to symbolize the lantern. We don’t see any of the other people the Beast turned into tree’s reappear, so why then does the daughter survive. Because she was the beast."

I have no competing theory to offer.
