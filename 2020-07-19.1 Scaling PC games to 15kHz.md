# Scaling PC games to 15kHz

## Technical Primer

This will be a very specific vertical slice of old tech but for those who don't know the significance of 15kHz and want to: it's the horizontal frequency used by old CRT TVs, and of course, old videogame consoles (up until and including the N64). The standard resolution that fits within a 15kHz signal is 480i 60Hz, or for most videogames: 240p 60Hz.

I have recently been revisiting CRTs and I currently use one attached to my older computer. As far as I know it is not possible to output 15kHz over a digital connection, so the first hurdle is having analog output. Luckily a good friend of mine gave me an old GTX980 GPU, the newest nvidia GPU to still support analog output. But for reasons I do not fully understand, you cannot simply set the resolution to 320x240. The only way it can work is if you set the resolution to what is known as a "super resolution", and in my case I have chosen 3840x240. The CRT does not care what the horizontal resolution is, the CRT only cares that there are 240 rows.

Now we can speak to the TV, but we have two final problems before we can use it. First: many PC games will not correctly display within 240p. Second: even if they did, Windows now thinks the monitor is 3840 pixels wide, and the aspect ratio is _very_ incorrect. Anything you put on the display will appear very compressed horizontally.

## Existing solutions

By far the easiest solution is to buy a specific purpose built product that accepts _normal_ resolutions and outputs 320x240 to the TV. You still need your computer to output analog (or you can buy a product to convert HDMI->VGA), but you can output a normal resolution like 720p, and the box will downscale that to 240p.

The second solution (which inspired my dirty hack) is to use a Raspberry Pi, one of the analog output modules for the Pi, and simply use that to play your desired game over SteamLink. With the appropriate analog output module product, the Pi can support 320x240. Using SteamLink, you render the game rendered remotely on your primary PC, in a normal resolution like 720p, and the remote stream can easily be resized by the Pi into 320x240.


## The Dirty Hack

After seeing the Pi method, I thought, hey! I've been looking for an excuse to buy a Pi! But I started thinking: well, the video player `mpv` has plenty of options that might be able to offset the 3840x240 problem. And who needs SteamLink anyway? It might be possible to configure OBS to output a local stream with low latency. Turns out, it can, and it is!

obs output file ffmpeg url
dual monitors
nvenc libx264 seems lower latency
profile=baseline tune=zerolatency
disable audio

test rescale output?
test obs preview output?

canvas resolution not as important as resolution of captured window. luckily there's the option to force scale the captured window down.
be mindful of scaling (canvas and forced scaling should be multiples of 3840x240p)

mpv manual has a section for low latency!
set mpv pixel aspect accordingly

`mpv -aid=no --profile=low-latency --untimed --opengl-glfinish=yes --opengl-swapinterval=0 --framedrop=no --speed=1.01 --monitoraspect=16:9 --monitorpixelaspect=16:9 --stream-buffer-size=4096 --screen=0 --fs-screen=0 udp://@0.0.0.0:9999`
