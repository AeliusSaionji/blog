## Overview

I firmly believe that good game design necessitates communicating to the player what actions they can and can't take at a given moment. I'm no professional, but I would think this is a fundamental concept in all UI design. Let's take a look at how your computer might relay information to you in a window.

Shown here, three items are "greyed out". It's pretty clear that the user cannot interact with these objects which they usually interact with. This is communicating to the user that they cannot perform those specific actions at this time. This is a simple, unobtrusive tactic which goes a long way to enhancing the user experience. Consider what this dialog would be like if it _didn't_ communicate these settings are unavailable; the user would interact with these buttons and become frustrated at the apparent mismatch between input and output. I clearly changed the settings, why am I not seeing the effect of the changes?

## This idea in gaming

Communicating what actions are available to the user makes a game feel responsive and fluid. Let's dive right into an example.

</video>

In the above video of `Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight`, I demonstrate rolling. In effect, this is an action which moves you quickly in a specific direction. Even though you are not controlling this yourself, I bet you could tell me exactly when the roll button will work, and when it won't. You can't roll while you're already rolling, so it makes logical, intuitive sense that the roll action will be unavailable until the character has stopped rolling. The rolling animation is what communicates to the player that they cannot just mash the roll button to quickly skip across long distances.

Here above is a demonstration of the in-air dash/dodge. This too is rate-limited; the button will not have an effect if pressed multiple times in quick succession. However, the exact moment when dash becomes available again is visually communicated by a bright flash and expanding circle around your character. The game communicates to you the exact moment when you may use dash again, allowing you to time your input accordingly.

Now let's look at `Hyper Light Drifter`.

<video loop controls>

</video>

I am mashing the dash button as fast as I can, repeatedly, for the entire duration of this video. There is clearly a rate limit after a sequence of three dashes, but there is no visual, audible, or haptic (vibration) feedback for this **at all**. This creates uncertainty; if I only dash twice successively, how long must I wait before I'm allowed to do multiple successive dashes again? This is not the kind of question I should be asking the game mid-battle. Furthermore, if you seek through this video frame-by-frame you won't find a frame where it is clear one dash has ended and a successive one may begin- dashing remains unavailable a moment or so after the previous dash's animation has ended, each blending into the other with no clear delineation. All of this contributes to a feeling of finicky unresponsiveness, and worse, it makes me feel like the dodge ability is unreliable in a pinch. A similar problem exists with your primary attack.

## Me vs Strawman

It is true that over time, you will naturally learn to 'feel out' the conditions and timings of a system like `Hyper Light Drifter`'s. However, one's ability to adapt to the problem doesn't place it above reproach. In `HLD`'s defense, there is an argument to be made that [imperfect controls are in line with the game's theme](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/02/hyper-light-drifter-heart-disease-inspired-alex-preston). I'm not writing this to pass judgement on `HLD`, though- it just happens to be that I played it around the same time I played `Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight`, and the two systems were begging to be contrasted.
