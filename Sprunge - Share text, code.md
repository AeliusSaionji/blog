You might have noticed I share text via the site <http://sprunge.us>

If you’ve ever shared code online you’re probably familiar with pastebin. I am not a fan of pastebin. We’re sharing text, why all the javascript, why the cookies, why the code interpreter? I suppose the numbered lines are useful, but 99% of the time I want to share **text** that the recipient can copy- or better yet, just save the page. No frill, no baggage, no fancy features. For the simple act of sharing text, pastebin is thoroughly _obnoxious_.

Sprunge works on all browsers, even terminal browsers. It shares text. Need to share text? Sprunge it. Forget pastebin.

As you can tell from the main page, the primary method of uploading text is via the command line; depending on your setup it might not be simple to use sprunge, but there are other services and tools that can help. I use VIM as my text editor, and [this plugin](https://github.com/chilicuil/vim-sprunge) allows me to upload the contents of the editor to sprunge freely.

You can’t really delete something that has been uploaded to sprunge, though. I contacted the site author about that once, and he was willing to do it but mentioned that it would be “a pain” to do so. I opted to not bother him about it. Don’t upload anything you might regret.

**Update**: <http://ix.io/> is a similar service, bit with the ability to create an account and delete shares.
