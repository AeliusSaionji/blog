A list of Android apps I keep on my phone. This list primarily exists for me to share with friends, and is otherwise pointless. Note that F-Droid apps do not have ads, and are open source. F-Droid is therefore devoid of bloat or spyware or other useless things that plague the Google Play store, and F-Droid is the repo I first search when looking for apps.

[[MORE]]

I've noted only the widgets I care about. I don't care about most widgets. All of the apps I use either have no ads, or can be removed by purchasing the ad-free version. I tried my best to find apps with true black themes for AMOLED displays. Coming from Windows Mobile, it's strange to me that black themes aren't just inherently in every single app. In fact, on Android black themes even seem unpopular!

## The List

- AnkiDroid
	- [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.ichi2.anki/) - [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ichi2.anki)
	- Black theme (enable night mode)

	> Flashcard app. Truthfully I haven't used this yet, but I used the desktop version in college.

- Article Reader
	- [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.olegsheremet.articlereader)
	- Black theme (in articles only, luckily that's where it counts)

	> Share webpages to this app for future offline reading. Only pictures and text are saved. I use this as my "read it later" list. Sometimes I use it just to extract content from ad-ridden websites: "read but don't save" is a second share target in addition to "save for later".

- Audio Recorder
	- [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.github.axet.audiorecorder/)
	- No black theme, only "dark" (grey) theme

	> Nothing much to say here. A simple app to record audio. I feel this should be a basic feature of all phones, and coming from Windows Mobile I was surprised this is not included with Android.

- Calendar (aka Simple Calendar)
	- [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.simplemobiletools.calendar/) - [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.simplemobiletools.calendar)
	- Black theme (choose dark theme, set custom background color to black)
	- Simple black transparent widget

	> Honestly, I haven't set up my calendar on Android yet. I will be using this app more once I do. It's a strange thing that stock Calendar app doesn't have anything other than a blinding white theme. The one drawback to this app is that you can't tap an event location to open your maps app.

- Call Recorder
	- [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.github.axet.callrecorder/)
	- No black theme, only "dark" (grey) theme

	> From the same author as "Audio Recorder". This is yet another basic feature of Windows Mobile that I'm missing on Android. This app can function without root access, but it's very hard to hear the caller. Apparently root access is required to actually record calls properly. I also dislike that all calls are always recorded: on Windows Mobile, there was simply a "record" button on the call screen.

- Car Report
	- [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/me.kuehle.carreport/) - [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.kuehle.carreport)
	- No black theme, but the dark UI makes significant use of the color black

	> Record the mileage, gas cost, gas consumtion, etc for your car. Also allows you to record general expenses, and create reminders based on time, distance, or mileage.

- Chan Burauza
	- [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=smugcat93.chanburauza)
	- Black theme
	- Developer is responsive! Got back to me after a few weeks
	- Contributes to the hideous trend of permanent, unchangeable folder creation

	> If you want an app to browse 4chan or other, this one is good. I haven't needed to look elsewhere.

- Custom Navigation Bar
	- [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=xyz.paphonb.systemuituner)
	- Requires some configuration by ADB

	> This is the app I use to enable persistent "immersive mode". It also allows you to add extra buttons to the navigation bar. I've added a button to mine that toggles "immersive mode", for the few buggy apps which don't behave without it. "Immersive mode" hides the navigation bar (and optionally the status bar), which is useful to prevent the status bar from burning in on the display. I also like the way true fullscreen looks.

- File Manager (aka Simple File Manager)
	- [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.simplemobiletools.filemanager/) - [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.simplemobiletools.filemanager)
	- Black theme (choose dark theme, set custom background color to black)

	> I bounced between a few file managers before eventually settling on this one. It's slightly uglier than the competition, but it's also very solid, fast, and fully featured. Everything from this developer [Simple Mobile Tools](https://simplemobiletools.github.io/) is fantastic.

- Gallery (aka Simple Gallery)
	- [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.simplemobiletools.gallery/) - [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.simplemobiletools.gallery)
	- Black theme (choose dark theme, set custom background color to black)

	> Another entry from [Simple Mobile Tools](https://simplemobiletools.github.io/). I tried to use the built in google photos, but it's just so bad. It's confusingly laid out, it's confusing when you're trying to have folders and it keeps making virtual albums that don't necessarily correspond to folders. It's confusing to tell which folder / album you're currently in. And worst sin of all: when invoked from another app, the back button does not exit+return to previous app. No, that makes too much sense for google photos. I also have issues with playing videos via google photos for some reason. I digress. Gallery is great! It does exactly what it should, and even has an extra feature to hide your porn. It even has a built in editor with basic functions like "crop". Gasp! Can google photos crop? No. No it can't. Fuck google photos. Update: I have been informed google photos can in fact crop. The confusingly hidden location was revealed to me. I still hate it.

- J Touch
	- [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bs.smarttouch.gp)

	> A floating button which replaces my navigation bar. You can tap, double tap, and swipe for different actions. Since I always hide my navigation bar, I need some other way to access `back`, `home`, and `recent`. There are many apps like this, but J Touch is the best implementation of this idea.

- JuiceSSH
	- [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sonelli.juicessh)
	- Black theme (only in terminal; better than nothing)

	> This is pretty basic. It's the most functional- floating buttons give you what you need. There's a text box for swiping keyboard input. I do have complaints: hitting URLs is obnoxious and hard. The volume keys are hijacked for resizing text, which is great until I want to change the volume. I'm definitely open to new suggestions for different apps.

- K-9 Mail
	- [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.fsck.k9/) - [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fsck.k9)
	- Black theme
	- Widget is a simple small unread counter

	> GMail and Outlook don't even have dark themes, let alone black. K-9 is great... once you've gone through the trouble of configuring it. Configuration is _tedious_. On the plus side, it can probably do anything you'd ever want to do with email. Back up that config.

- KISS Launcher
	- [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/fr.neamar.kiss/) - [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.neamar.kiss)
	- Transparent themes

	> For all the hype about "Android lets you change your home app to whatever you want!", most of the launchers are exactly the same idea with implemented with varying degrees of competence. Every launcher is some variation on: paginated left/right scrolling + an App drawer. What about scrolling vertically? Why does scrolling have to be paginated? Well, KISS completely bucks this paradigm and does something entirely new. KISS is just a list of my recently used apps/contacts + favorites bar. I love it.

- Le Face Keyboard
	- [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.uberfables.leface.keyboard)
	- No black theme, only dark (grey)

	> I'm not a big fan of emoji, but I do love kaomoji. Kaomoji are emoticons built with existing characters, usually Japanese. The well known `¯\_(ツ)_/¯` is one example. This keyboard doesn't have the biggest starting collection, but of the many different keyboards I tried, I found this one to be the nicest and easiest to use.

- Loop Habit Tracker
	- [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.isoron.uhabits/) - [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.isoron.uhabits)
	- Black theme
	- Simple black transparent widget

	> A simple app where you log your progress in forming new habits. For example, I'm trying to read more. If I've read today, I tap the widget I've created for my "read" habit. Within the app this data is used to generate graphs from the collected data.

- Media Merger
	- [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.github.axet.mover/) - [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.axet.mover)

	> This is a background process which helps deal with Android's hideous trend of permanent, unchangeable folder creation. It monitors selected folders for files. If files are found, they are moved to the preconfigured destination folder. I use this to move pictures from various apps into the Pictures folder. Where they belong. Fight me, every android dev.

- Monospace
	- [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.underwood.monospace)
	- Black theme

	> A simple-ish text editor with markdown support. Good text editors are deceptively hard to create for mobile devices. One feature I look for is autosaving, such that no data is lost during unexpected app crashes or unexpected phone shutdown. Monospace does this. Unfortunately, there's a minor bug where I can sometimes see an infinite loading circle. It's a nice app, but I'm not sure if it's for me. I don't really need or want the markdown or tagged storage system.

- MuPDF
	- [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.artifex.mupdfdemo/) - [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.artifex.mupdfdemo)
	- No black theme, but it sort of doesn't matter

	> I wanted  a PDF reader that wasn't google drive. This one works well. Yay.

- NewPipe
	- [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.schabi.newpipe/)
	- Black theme

	> This is a YouTube client that supports background playback for just audio, and supports playing videos in a tiny window over other apps. Basically, it has all the YouTube Red features. It's a bit clunky for me, but this has the potential to replace the official YouTube app.

- Notes (aka Simple Notes)
	- [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.simplemobiletools.notes/) - [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.simplemobiletools.notes)
	- Black theme (choose dark theme, set custom background color to black)

	> Another entry from [Simple Mobile Tools](https://simplemobiletools.github.io/). I've had really bad luck with typing into web pages and apps. Not even just on phones, on the computer too. I've lost a wall of text wayyyy too many times. If I'm going to type more than a line, I'm going to type it in a dedicated app that will not lose what I've typed even if the app or the phone crashes. Here's a good app for that.

- Palabre
	- [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.levelup.palabre)
	- Black theme

	> RSS readers are surprisingly bad on Android. Palabre is, to my knowledge, the only RSS app that can 1) grab the text/images of an article without using a browser to render the origin webpage (thereby running JS, ads, creating cookies, letting websites spy on me and waste my battery), and 2) also has a black theme. It's a little inelegant, however. I'm going to email the developer a few suggestions, but I doubt I'll get a response. Open to suggestions here.

- Password Store
	- [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=com.zeapo.pwdstore) - [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zeapo.pwdstore)
	- No black theme

	> Password manager for use with [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/).

- Podcast Republic
	- [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.itunestoppodcastplayer.app)
	- Black theme

	> Like RSS readers, Android has a dearth of good podcast apps. Podcast Republic is the least worst podcast app I could find, and the playlist management here is still insane. The good news is that, while the developers did not respond to my email, my two talking points were addressed in the very next update. Coincidence? Maybe. Maybe they'll listen to me if I send them another email about making playlists not stupid. Other than issues with playlists, this app is rock solid and does everything you'd ever need a podcast app to do.

- Simple weather & clock widget
	- [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.difer.weather)
	- Simple black transparent widget

	> I wanted a good weather widget, this is what I found.

- Slide for Reddit
	- [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/me.ccrama.redditslide/) - [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.ccrama.redditslide)
	- Black theme

	> I actually don't remember why the official Reddit app offended me. I think I just got tired of seeing ads or recommended posts and subreddits. Slide is a good replacement.

- Smart Wallpaper
	- [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.feedk.smartwallpaper)

	> All I wanted was a simple app to change my wallpapers on an interval. Shockingly hard to find a decent one. Smart Wallpaper has several more conditions for changing wallpapers than I need (location, times of day, etc), and it also doesn't monitor folders: you have to import pictures into a collection within Smart Wallpaper. But it gets the job done. Open to new suggestions.

- Stitchcraft
	- [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.zheteng.android.stitchcraft)
	- No black theme

	> An app to stitch screenshots together into one picture. Also adds a "take screenshot" button to the tiles above the Android notification center, something I really like since I find the pwr+voldown button combo tedious. This app comes in both ad-supported and paid. I've linked to the paid version above.

- Turbo Client
	- [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=turbo.client)
	- No black theme, only dark (grey)
	- Contributes to the hideous trend of permanent, unchangeable folder creation

	> Transfers files over SCP/SFTP. Shockingly, I can find no other competent Android apps for this.

- Twidere
	- [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.mariotaku.twidere/) - [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mariotaku.twidere)
	- Black theme
	- Transparent theme!

	> I got sick of Twitter showing me promoted tweets and ads. This is better than the official Twitter app, with the caveat that it does not yet organize replies into neat threads the way Twitter does, nor does it have the "popular things you missed" section that Twitter sometimes shows you. Otherwise, great app. One other thing you should know: notifications for retweets and likes are limited to the official Twitter app. Luckily, Twidere can pretend to be the official real deal, but it requires a little know-how on your part.
