A list of Android apps I keep on my phone. This list primarily exists for me to share with friends, and is otherwise pointless. Note that F-Droid apps do not have ads, and are open source. F-Droid is therefore devoid of bloat or spyware or other useless things that plague the Google Play store, and F-Droid is the repo I first search when looking for apps.

<!-- more -->

I've noted only the widgets I care about. I don't care about most widgets. All of the apps I use either have no ads, or can be removed by purchasing the ad-free version. I tried my best to find apps with true black themes for AMOLED displays. Coming from Windows Mobile, it's strange to me that black themes aren't just inherently in every single app. In fact, on Android black themes even seem unpopular!

## The List

- AnkiDroid
	- [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.ichi2.anki/) - [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ichi2.anki)
	- Black theme (enable night mode)

	> Flashcard app. Truthfully I haven't used this yet, but I used the desktop version in college.

- Article Reader
	- [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.olegsheremet.articlereader)
	- Black theme (in articles only, luckily that's where it counts)

	> Share webpages to this app for future offline reading. Only pictures and text are saved. I use this as my "read it later" list. Sometimes I use it just to extract content from ad-ridden websites: "read but don't save" is a second share target in addition to "save for later".

- Audio Recorder
	- [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.github.axet.audiorecorder/)
	- No black theme, only "dark" (grey) theme

	> Nothing much to say here. A simple app to record audio. I feel this should be a basic feature of all phones, and coming from Windows Mobile I was surprised this is not included with Android.

- Calendar (aka Simple Calendar)
	- [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.simplemobiletools.calendar/) - [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.simplemobiletools.calendar)
	- Black theme (choose dark theme, set custom background color to black)
	- Simple black transparent widget

	> Honestly, I haven't set up my calendar on Android yet. I will be using this app more once I do. It's a strange thing that stock Calendar app doesn't have anything other than a blinding white theme.

- Call Recorder
	- [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.github.axet.callrecorder/)
	- No black theme, only "dark" (grey) theme

	> From the same author as "Audio Recorder". This is yet another basic feature of Windows Mobile that I'm missing on Android. This app can function without root access, but it's very hard to hear the caller. Apparently root access is required to actually record calls properly. I also dislike that all calls are always recorded: on Windows Mobile, there was simply a "record" button on the call screen.

- Car Report
	- [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/me.kuehle.carreport/) - [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.kuehle.carreport)
	- No black theme, but the dark UI makes significant use of the color black

	> Record the mileage, gas cost, gas consumtion, etc for your car. Also allows you to record general expenses, and create reminders based on time, distance, or mileage.

- Clover
	-[F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.floens.chan/)
	- Black theme

	> If you want an imageboard browser, this is as good as any. Supports webm with audio, does anything I'd ever expect such an app to do.

- Custom Navigation Bar
	- [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=xyz.paphonb.systemuituner)
	- Requires some configuration by ADB

	> This is the app I use to enable persistent "immersive mode". It also allows you to add extra buttons to the navigation bar. I've added a button to mine that toggles "immersive mode", for the few buggy apps which don't behave without it. "Immersive mode" hides the navigation bar (and optionally the status bar), which is useful to prevent the status bar from burning in on the display. I also like the way true fullscreen looks.

- DAVdroid
	- [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/at.bitfire.davdroid/) - [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.bitfire.davdroid)

	> Sync your calendar, contacts, and tasks to a personal server.

- Edge Gestures
	- [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ss.edgegestures)

	> The navigation bar is old news. It's too hard to reach on bigger phones and takes of screen real estate. Use gestures from an edge of the screen to control your phone instead.

- File Manager (aka Simple File Manager)
	- [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.simplemobiletools.filemanager/) - [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.simplemobiletools.filemanager)
	- Black theme (choose dark theme, set custom background color to black)

	> I bounced between a few file managers before eventually settling on this one. It's slightly uglier than the competition, but it's also very solid, fast, and fully featured. Everything from this developer [Simple Mobile Tools](https://simplemobiletools.github.io/) is fantastic.

- Flym
	- [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/net.frju.flym/) - [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.frju.flym)
	- Dark theme

	> RSS readers on android have not been kind to me. I was using the FOSS app Feeder for quite a while, but the dev is not in a hurry to implement full text article retrieval. Flym got a recent mid-2018 major revamp, and it has all the features I want but it just doesn't feel as lightweight as Feeder. It also seems a bit less reliable in its background updater, and I really dislike the UI page separation of Unread / All items. I'll probably return to Feeder if the dev starts working on it again.

- ForRunners
	- The current stable version is rather broken, I'm running a beta build for version 1.2.x. Since the working version isn't readily available, I won't share links.
	
	> A little more than basic FOSS app for recording your run/bike/whathaveyou. It's the only FOSS option I could find.

- Gallery (aka Simple Gallery)
	- [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.simplemobiletools.gallery/) - [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.simplemobiletools.gallery)
	- Black theme (choose dark theme, set custom background color to black)

	> Another entry from [Simple Mobile Tools](https://simplemobiletools.github.io/). I tried to use the built in google photos, but it's just so bad. It's confusingly laid out, it's confusing when you're trying to have folders and it keeps making virtual albums that don't necessarily correspond to folders. It's confusing to tell which folder / album you're currently in. And worst sin of all: when invoked from another app, the back button does not exit+return to previous app. No, that makes too much sense for google photos. I also have issues with playing videos via google photos for some reason. I digress. Gallery is great! It does exactly what it should, and even has an extra feature to hide your porn. It even has a built in editor with basic functions like "crop". Gasp! Can google photos crop? No. No it can't. Fuck google photos. Update: I have been informed google photos can in fact crop. The confusingly hidden location was revealed to me. I still hate it.

- K-9 Mail
	- [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.fsck.k9/) - [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fsck.k9)
	- Black theme
	- Widget is a simple small unread counter

	> GMail and Outlook don't even have dark themes, let alone black. K-9 is great... once you've gone through the trouble of configuring it. Configuration is _tedious_. On the plus side, it can probably do anything you'd ever want to do with email. Back up that config.

- KISS Launcher
	- [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/fr.neamar.kiss/) - [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.neamar.kiss)
	- Transparent themes

	> For all the hype about "Android lets you change your home app to whatever you want!", most of the launchers are exactly the same idea with implemented with varying degrees of competence. Every launcher is some variation on: paginated left/right scrolling + an App drawer. What about scrolling vertically? Why does scrolling have to be paginated? Well, KISS completely bucks this paradigm and does something entirely new. KISS is just a list of my recently used apps/contacts + favorites bar. I love it.

- Loop Habit Tracker
	- [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.isoron.uhabits/) - [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.isoron.uhabits)
	- Black theme
	- Simple black transparent widget

	> A simple app where you log your progress in forming new habits. For example, I'm trying to read more. If I've read today, I tap the widget I've created for my "read" habit. Within the app this data is used to generate graphs from the collected data.

- Materialistic
	- [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/io.github.hidroh.materialistic/) - [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.github.hidroh.materialistic)
	- Black theme

	> Hacker news reader.

- Media Merger
	- [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.github.axet.mover/) - [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.axet.mover)

	> This is a background process which helps deal with Android's hideous trend of permanent, unchangeable folder creation. It monitors selected folders for files. If files are found, they are moved to the preconfigured destination folder. I use this to move pictures from various apps into the Pictures folder. Where they belong. Fight me, every android dev.

- MuPDF
	- [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.artifex.mupdfdemo/) - [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.artifex.mupdfdemo)
	- No black theme, but it sort of doesn't matter

	> I wanted  a PDF reader that wasn't google drive. This one works well. Yay.

- NewPipe
	- [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.schabi.newpipe/)
	- Black theme

	> This is a YouTube client that supports background playback for just audio, and supports playing videos in a tiny window over other apps. Basically, it has all the YouTube Red features. It's a bit clunky for me, but this has the potential to replace the official YouTube app.

- Notes (aka Simple Notes)
	- [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.simplemobiletools.notes/) - [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.simplemobiletools.notes)
	- Black theme (choose dark theme, set custom background color to black)

	> Another entry from [Simple Mobile Tools](https://simplemobiletools.github.io/). I've had really bad luck with typing into web pages and apps. Not even just on phones, on the computer too. I've lost a wall of text wayyyy too many times. If I'm going to type more than a line, I'm going to type it in a dedicated app that will not lose what I've typed even if the app or the phone crashes. Here's a good app for that.

- OpenScale
	- [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.health.openscale/) - [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.health.openscale)
	- Dark theme

	> I'm a fatty, trying to lose weight. Logging my weight data in here gives me a nice graph to track my progress.

- Password Store
	- [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=com.zeapo.pwdstore) - [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zeapo.pwdstore)
	- No black theme

	> Password manager for use with [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/).

- Peace of Mind+
	- [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/ca.mudar.fairphone.peaceofmind/) - [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ca.mudar.fairphone.peaceofmind)
	
	> Enable "Do Not Disturb" mode for set periods of time, after which the ringer is enabled again.

- Podcast Republic
	- [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.itunestoppodcastplayer.app)
	- Black theme

	> Like RSS readers, Android has a dearth of good podcast apps. Podcast Republic is the least worst podcast app I could find, and the playlist management here is still insane. The good news is that, while the developers did not respond to my email, my two talking points were addressed in the very next update. Coincidence? Maybe. Maybe they'll listen to me if I send them another email about making playlists not stupid. Other than issues with playlists, this app is rock solid and does everything you'd ever need a podcast app to do.

- QKSMS
	- [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.moez.QKSMS/) - [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.moez.QKSMS)
	- Black theme

	> Stock Google messenger uploads your SMS to some server somewhere, so I dumped it. QKSMS seems to have had a reboot/revival in 2018. This new version is solidly stable, pleasant to use and has all the basic features one would expect in SMS/MMS.

- QuickDic
	- [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/de.reimardoeffinger.quickdic/) - [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.reimardoeffinger.quickdic)
	- Dark theme

	> An offline dictionary. Quickly reference words and phrases. An example phrase I was surprised to find in this app was "Halcyon days".

- Scrambled Exif
	- [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.jarsilio.android.scrambledeggsif/) - [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jarsilio.android.scrambledeggsif)

	> This app works in-line with the share menu. The function is to strip exif data from images for further sharing. The original image is not touched, instead a temporary image is created and the share menu is reopened which acts upon this temporary image. 

- Share via HTTP
	- [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.MarcosDiez.shareviahttp/) - [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.MarcosDiez.shareviahttp)

	> Share files to this app, and they will be hosted via HTTP server. A simple and effective way of moving files to another device.

- Slide for Reddit
	- [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/me.ccrama.redditslide/) - [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.ccrama.redditslide)
	- Black theme

	> I actually don't remember why the official Reddit app offended me. I think I just got tired of seeing ads or recommended posts and subreddits. Slide is a good replacement.

- Stitchcraft
	- [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.zheteng.android.stitchcraft)
	- No black theme

	> An app to stitch screenshots together into one picture. Also adds a "take screenshot" button to the tiles above the Android notification center, something I really like since I find the pwr+voldown button combo tedious. This app comes in both ad-supported and paid. I've linked to the paid version above.

- Turbo Client
	- [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=turbo.client)
	- No black theme, only dark (grey)
	- Contributes to the hideous trend of permanent, unchangeable folder creation

	> Transfers files over SCP/SFTP with easy UI. Shockingly, I can find no other competent Android apps for this. Fat-fingering scp in Termux is not a solution.

- Twidere
	- [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.mariotaku.twidere/) - [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mariotaku.twidere)
	- Black theme
	- Transparent theme!

	> I got sick of Twitter showing me promoted tweets and ads. This is better than the official Twitter app, with the caveat that it does not yet organize replies into neat threads the way Twitter does, nor does it have the "popular things you missed" section that Twitter sometimes shows you. Otherwise, great app. One other thing you should know: notifications for retweets and likes are limited to the official Twitter app. Luckily, Twidere can pretend to be the official real deal, but it requires a little know-how on your part.
