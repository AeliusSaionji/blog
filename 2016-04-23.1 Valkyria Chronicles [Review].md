This is not a strategy game. It starts out pretending to be one, but that illusion is shattered after the first few missions. The gameplay from there on is miserable. I started having a good time when I started save scumming. There is definitely one correct way to approach each challenge, and past the first few levels it's never "strategy". You can try to use strategy, you might even win, but missions can easily be half an hour long when you don't take the one correct approach, and losing half an hour of progress like that made me really bitter- particularly if the RNG decided to test your patience. I may have felt differently if there were checkpoints- at least on some levels, you could conceivably play "fairly" and have a proper, engaging challenge, but the time-cost of losing is just too high for that to be rewarding.

Here are but a few complaints (the ones I can remember at the time of writing)

* RNG applies to grenades. Sometimes, a grenade kills everyone. Sometimes, shoving a grenade up one enemy's cornhole does literally 0 damage.
* The RNG is really strange, and not affected by distance or weapon type (not nearly to the extent it should be, at least). Snipers, tanks, rocket launchers? Flip a coin, it will either hit or miss, it does not matter how close or far away you are, your odds of landing the hit don't really change all that much. The enemy AI seems to be aware of this and it is not uncommon for your sniper to miss, but for the enemy tank at the other end of the friggin map to headshot your sniper out of a distant watchtower WITH A MISSILE. It was funny the first time. It's less funny each time it happens.
* Headshots apply to missiles/rocket launchers, because of course you can shrug off a missile to the leg!
* Actually a common theme in this game is "arbitrary logic", it's hard for you to operate strategically when you can't anticipate how things are going to behave.
* Speaking of unpredictability, here is an example- multiple allies can participate in an attack, if they have line of sight and are near enough, and if they're not snipers/rocketlauncherguys. And also if the RNG decides they should. It's infuriating when you SHOULD be getting that supporting fire, but you didn't, and the enemy is still alive, and they single handedly kill everyone. Similarly, your characters automatically fire upon nearby enemies (not snipers/rocketlaunchers)... if the enemy goes into their extremely narrow line of sight.... and if the RNG decides they should. I often would place units in positions I needed defended, only to have the enemy waltz over without interruption. Welp, he just oneshotted the story-essential tank, Game over!
* Clearly seeing the enemy down your scope doesn't mean the trajectory of the projectile is clear. When the shooting animation starts, you might find that your character's gun is actually in the wall (or other nearby object).

I started out on the PS3 version years back, never finished the game. At the time, I didn't know you could save scum (let alone save at all mid battle). Bought the PC version upon release. I played this at 120fps and the game looks stunning. Tanks used to have severe collision issues at 120fps, but that was (mostly? entirely?) patched out. I'm not actually sure what bugs were framerate and what bugs are just inherit to the game. Even with the patch, whatever isn't pre-rendered has out of sync audio. It's not deal breaking.

There are a few moments in a few levels where you might benefit from switching to 30fps- I can't remember if this was patched out, but there was one level where driving your tank up an incline would consume more than twice as many movement points than normal. 120fps will cost you a few wasted turns there. All pre rendered cutscenes are 30fps at some god awful resolution.
I just beat the game, and the mission before the final boss has a ramp that no soldier can cross at 120fps. You must limit the framerate to 30fps to traverse that ramp. You are required to cross that ramp to beat the level. That said, most of the gameplay can be done at your desired resolution and framerate, and it looks spectacular.

The story is pretty cringeworthy, but I'm a sucker for this particular brand of bad; I find it endearing. It's true that there is no depth, but on the other hand, as silly as the characters are, there are actually characters. The camera angle is 3rd person shooter style- up close and personal. Each character is visually unique, and comes with their own voice actor, lines, and personality. You'll love some, and hate others. This will affect your decisions about who to send out into danger, and who you panick over when they need to be evacuated from the field (downed characters will permanently die if the enemy touches them, and if you don't get to them by the next turn or so). The combat system and gameplay would be great, if it weren't so terrible!

I find this approach to be much more effective than xcom's: a very zoomed out camera doesn't let you see your units too well. They're just ants with very little to distinguish individuals, and I had no emotional reaction when one of them died except, "wow there goes a lot of time and resources I spent leveling him up".

And, well, despite xcom being the objectively better game, I dropped xcom and finished Valkyria Chronicles.

This game has pretty high "highs" and very low "lows".
