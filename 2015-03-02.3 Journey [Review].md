I just played the PS3 game Journey. Like Ico and Shadow of the Colossus, there is no tutorial, there are no words, it is the doing that drives the game. I want to examine the co op feature specifically: in each level you are paired with a random player. They can help you, they can (minimally) hinder you, they can completely ignore you, and the only form of communication you have is to "sing". A single button causes your character to sing, and through that you can signal other players to do something, or just sing together in harmony.

In the beginning, one player and I were gliding down a dune in the desert, singing and dancing with each other as we went. It was an incredible and thoroughly unique experience. Other mechanics of the cooperative play: huddling close together will cause your energy to regenerate (for jumping), and holding down the sing button will give a burst of energy to another player within range. When coordinated correctly, one player can help another reach heights that they cannot jump to alone. My luck with companions was great, or perhaps the game inspires goodness in players. Only one out of the four people I played with was clueless and had no desire to explore or work cooperatively, and s/he left me behind rather fast as I discovered the secrets of one level.

I was really struck by the end level of the game; the objective was to scale a snowy mountain, and it was clear my companion and I were dying: our songs were weaker, our energy drained unless we huddled together for warmth (with monsters about, it was quite frightening). Every time my companion fell behind or was spotted by a monster, I did my best to assist and distract the monster, as I had the advantage, having gathered a large capacity of energy through secrets in earlier levels.

It occurred to me that I did not know, and could not know, if I was helping a fragile little girl, or a fat old man. Suddenly it wasn't just a game to me- I was with someone, a real person, and we were entirely defined by our actions, nothing else. We could not judge each other based on gender or appearance, nor any external trait- a position I have never been in in my life. 

My companion and I, narrowly avoiding death, complete the last leg of the journey with what appears to be energy or inspiration given to us by gods, or figments of our imagination. The door to what presumably was metaphorical heaven lay before us, and I walked towards it. But my companion did not, instead singing and running around. I walked back to see why I was not being accompanied. Only then did I realize that as my companion ran about, tracks were left in the snow, and s/he purposefully drew me many hearts in the snow, chirping as s/he worked. I clumsily traced a few hearts in return, then we departed side by side. 

After the credits rolled, the game supplied me with the usernames of my companions. I looked at the profile of the one who I helped, the one who drew me hearts, and learned that she was a girl from japan, and her profile indicated her first language was unsurprisingly Japanese. Then it doubly struck me just how incredible this game is: I had an impact on someone, I befriended someone even, in the real world. Sure, I had made online friends through games before, but never before without speaking- never before purely by virtue of our interactions. It did not matter that she lived across the world from me, it did not matter that we speak different languages; through this game, if only for a brief time, we impacted each others' lives, and created an experience together that I will always remember.
