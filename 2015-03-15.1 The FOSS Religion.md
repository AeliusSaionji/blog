FOSS: Free Open Source Software

Are you familiar with the stereotype of the obnoxious religious person? People who aren’t content in having faith, but also need to lecture and condemn others who don’t share their beliefs?

Plenty of groups have received their share of ridicule for this type of behavior- whether or not this is deserved is not my place to say. But there is a group of individuals who I have never seen ridiculed for this behavior, and by golly do they deserve it: the in your face, FOSS is the only answer, any person who writes closed source (or god forbid, sells it) software is the devil, insufferably obtuse, rather naive, open source fan boy.

Sorry for the mouth full. I want to make it clear I’m not in any way decrying open source software or the developers who write it. I love FOSS. There are so many robust, well written open source programs that I personally benefit from. Plenty of closed source ones too.

But there is nothing wrong with closed source software. There’s nothing wrong with charging money for software you write. Microsoft is not an evil corporation out to destroy all you hold dear (well, it has been like 10 years since they last tried to do that). Kindly remove your heads from your asses when discussing software online.

That is all.
