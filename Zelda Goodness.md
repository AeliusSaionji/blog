I'm playing Ocarina of Time while my nephew watches, and I'm trying to figure out why it's so good. The main thing that sticks out to me is every single lesser NPC character, no matter how unimportant they are, has an actual tangible personality [trait], made memorable by exaggerated emoting built right into their character animation. They all have something to say, too, and quite a bit of the dialog from NPC characters serves no other purpose than world building immersion- you can actually act on very little of what is said, but if you talk to everyone in a given town you'll gain some insight into the lives of the villagers and so on... It goes a long way to make the towns actually feel _alive_ and bustling with activity. Of course you need to talk to the right people to advance to the next area, so if you don't know who to talk to, you're not going to miss this dose of world building. If you know who to talk to, chances are you're replaying the game (like me) and you'll want to talk to everyone anyway because there is a high frequency of characters casually dropping very vague hints or game secrets- and despite the number of times I've played this game it's still difficult for me to tell if a character is musing for the sake of world building, or s/he's giving me a hint about something. Straddling that line of "is this just worldbuilding fluff or is the character referring to a secret I'm unaware of?" keeps the awe and wonder alive.

Excluding other Zelda games, I can't really think of another game with this level of NPC characterization for the sake of world building, except perhaps for Persona 4. But even in P4, if the dialog isn't world building it's a blatantly unabashed fetch quest. Zelda on the other hand tends to have the NPCs do the vague hint dropping I mentioned, and it always *plays* out interactively and dynamically so you don't feel like you're just changing variables in a computer program. Combined with being mentally stimulating, the whole process is generally very rewarding and you wouldn't even think of it as a "side mission" because it seamlessly integrates into the exploration of the game's world- something the player naturally gravitates to. P4's side missions definitely just feel like fetch quests.

There are a lot of small details that elevate this game above simple input / output monotony. When you fight Gohma in the Deku Tree, you enter the room and hear the rustling of a spider, a mechanic which had been present earlier in the form of golden skulltulas. You hear the rustling of golden skulltulas, a creature that does not move or pursue you so you must search for them to collect the reward they drop. If you weren't already inclined to look around when you can hear but not see something- the game cleverly utilizes this mechanic to entice you to look around. When you look around the room, you then see a glowing orb in the darkness on the ceiling- Gohma's eye. If you look at it long enough (a second or so), she notices you are watching her. Eye contact is made- and THEN the boss battle sequence starts. Beautiful.

Funny story: it never occurred to me that Zelda as a child doesn't actually have any authority within Hyrule- she's the princess, but when I was a kid playing this game I didn't realize that she was also just a kid. So ~12 year old Zelda gives Link, a ~12 year old kid, a hand written letter that basically says he's the hero who's going to save the world, so the guards should give you access to areas otherwise off limits. The guard you show it to subsequently laughs his ass off. As a ~12 year old kid myself I didn't understand why he was laughing and never gave it much thought. For some reason it never occurred to me until today, over a decade later, to look at it from the guard's perspective. A child runs up to you bearing an official document, written in sloppy handwriting by the child princess, the contents read "this boy is a hero and he is going to save the world!" ...lolol.

The most profound thing about Ocarina of Time is that it came out of Japan but you would never know it by playing the game! I kid- mostly. Sorry Japan, but you overuse a lot of tropes in most of your media I've consumed and I'm developing an aversion to it.
