I recently discovered [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/), which has inspired me to dust off my Nook Simple Touch Glowlight and load it up with reading material. Once I downloaded every title I recognized, I turned my attention to comics and manga. Many e-readers do not support `cbz`, unfortunately, which has given rise to a number of projects that convert your manga into `epub` (or whatever Amazon's proprietary format is).

In years past I used [Manga to ePub](http://mangatoepub.codeplex.com/) to get the job done, but I was never impressed by that program. The next program I found, [Kindle Comic Converter](https://github.com/ciromattia/kcc) looks better and is still maintained, but unfortunately I encountered a [show stopping problem](https://github.com/ciromattia/kcc/issues/217). The developer did agree to fix this at some point in the future, but this was not my only problem with KCC. Its `ePub` files could not be opened by [zathura](https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/), and [this snippet of text](https://github.com/ciromattia/kcc/wiki/Important-tips#metadata) generally does not fill me with confidence in the software.

Criticisms aside, the whole process of storing images in an `ePub` is clearly just overcomplicated, and there only exist a few small programs to do this. I hate it when my workflow relies on a single rickety and obscure program. I need to find a simpler solution. The nook's stock reader doesn't give me much to work with: as far as I know, my only options are `ePub` and `PDF`.

I set aside my anti-PDF bias for a moment and [discovered](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8955425/how-can-i-convert-a-series-of-images-to-a-pdf-from-the-command-line-on-linux) that `ImageMagick` can just output to `PDF`. This isn't quite the end of the journey, as the nook's downscaling algorithm causes significant aliasing. After reading the IM manpage about resizing images and running through a few trials, I settled on this command:

<pre><code>convert *.png -filter Lanczos -resize 515x715 output.pdf</code></pre>

Assuming `*.png` expands to your list of images. My nook's resolution is `600x800`, but it doesn't allow you to configure margins for `PDF` documents; I guestimated the actual display area and used that for the `PDF` page dimensions. Note that the `output` in `output.pdf` becomes the document's metadata title.

There you have it; a simple, reliable, and mature, no-nonsense process to get comics into an e-reader.

Alternatively, you could root your nook and use an `android 2.1` app which supports `cbz`. I couldn't find one that worked with the hardware buttons, but I do intend to contact the developer of [ComicsReader](http://dev.kervala.net/projects/comicsreader/wiki) to see if we can fix that.

## Update 2017/02/11

As of several days ago, not only has the KCC dev solved the nook problem, now generated `ePub` files are valid enough for `zathura` to open. These fixes are found in the dev branch at the time of writing.

## Update 2017/03/04

At the end of the day, the best answer is to find a way to just use the right format, and avoid conversion. On that note, I looked into buying a new e-reader, but unfortunately the latest lineups from big name products (kindle, nook, kobo) are crap! If the battery life is good, it doesn't support any formats. If it supports a range of formats, it needs to be charged every night. Pathetic storage space with no option to expand via SD, and all incredibly overpriced. It honestly looks my current (rooted) Nook is the best available e-reader!

Tangent aside, I want a way to just open `cbz` on the nook. [ComicsReader](http://dev.kervala.net/projects/comicsreader/wiki) will only remember your position for the most recently opened file, which is not good enough. [FBReaderJ](https://fbreader.org/FBReaderJ) does extend support as far back as `Android 1.6`, but not for its comic (`cbz`) plugin. [ACV](https://f-droid.org/wiki/page/net.androidcomics.acv) to the rescue. It won't respond to the nook's physical buttons, but it's perfect in every other aspect- including, of course, high quality downscale.
