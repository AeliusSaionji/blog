frogpad game sold me on frogpad
so easy to type on the four by three grid you start out on even without ortholinear

settled on keybr as the least layout hardcoded tool i could find
because keybr focuses on letters i can start typing now and ignore the fact that i have not yet implemented punctuation. too many qwerty typing tools want to start right off with the semicolon

soon frustrated by the frogpad keys which leave the four by three grid

several day detour in which i found a qmk bug and help the devs fix it

eventually get over it

annoyed by the ergodox pinky column which isnt low enough for my short pinky though it seems fine in practice
still considering different keycaps to see if i can fix this

notice a marked improvement in learning new keys when returning from short breaks

still struggling to make qmk chord well
strange old tmk design decisions hinder me

seven and a half hours in and i average thirty five wpm in keybr
not all leters yet but close enough to type

i notice that as my speed increases i make more mistakes
the shift from brain thinking about letters to thinking about words
i can do the letters easily
but at higher speeds my brain is still translating words direct to qwerty

eight hours and thirty minutes in and i have completed the keybr training to the point where it is not focusing on a single key anymore

nine hours in and i can hit fifty wpm sometimes on keybr

I have been noticing a bug for a while, one that swallows space sometimes. Fixed! 9h50m in and with this bug fixed, I can now exceed 50 wpm.

10 hours fifteen min I have reached 60 wpm in keybr. No wait! 67!

I have been using my keyboard as my primary input for 2 months now, and I have not done any formal speed tests or training for much longer than that. There was a period of time where I did not use this keyboard at all before adopting it as my primary input. Picking it up again was not difficult.
My rate of errors is rather high and this is frusrating. There are still times where I blank out and can't find one of the lesser used keys. I have comma, period, ? and ! where I want them, but the rest of the symbols are not as accessible as I would like them to be.
I just tested myself on keybr and averaged 45, maxed out at 57 early on and plummeted from there. I think keybr is not reflecting real world conditions, but it does probably reflect my current wpm. Keybr made me sad so I will put it aside for now.
