I recently found this by accident: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/threat-protection/windows-defender-exploit-guard/enable-controlled-folders-exploit-guard>. It's a new feature for Windows 10, where your personal files are made read-only to all programs not in the allow list. The intent is primarily to fight cryptoviruses: the virus may be on your machine, but it can't encrypt read-only files.

I turned this feature on, played a game for 3 hours, and then lost all progress in said game because it did not have write-access to my Documents folder. D'oh! That's something to remember: be aware of where games (and programs) are storing saves and configuration files. You will get a popup notification when a process is blocked, but you will not see it in a fullscreen game. Use <https://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Home> to look up where games saves and configs are located.

## Configuring

- Open `Windows Defender Security Center`
- Navigate to `Virus & threat protection`
- Open `Virus & threat protection settings`
- Scroll down to `Controlled folder access`.

Here you can turn the feature on as well as manage the list of protected folders, and allowed processes. Unfortunately, you are not able to remove any of the default entries.

## Sensible Allow List

Controlled folder access means serious business. It appears the only process allowed by default is `explorer.exe`, despite that not being listed. Several processes built into Windows 10 are not allowed, inhibiting certain features. I will update and maintain the following list of my personal exclusions.

### Xbox DVR

- C:\Windows\ImmersiveControlPanel\SystemSettings.exe
- C:\Windows\System32\bcastdvr.exe

### Xbox App: View Screenshots & Videos

- C:\Windows\System32\RuntimeBroker.exe

###GoG Galaxy: cloud save service

- C:\ProgramData\GOG.com\Galaxy\redists\GalaxyCommunication.exe

### WindowsApps: Allow saving files in protected folders

- C:\Windows\System32\PickerHost.exe
