# Multiple Monitor Woes

Soon, I hope to retire my three `Asus VG248QE` and find something with more color accuracy, and a deeper contrast ratio. I will not be buying three this time around.

I've been using a three monitor spread for over five years. Before jumping down this rabbit hole, I remember one of my friends warning me that there's no point- "you're' just greedy for power!", but I didn't listen. I enjoyed the extra space, and the ability to multitask while running fullscreen applications (video games, movies, and so on). I could easily reference an online guide on the second monitor- I had no need for XFire's newfangled browser overlay! And not too long ago nVidia introduced their `surround` technology, allowing me to play games in ultra wide!

But in the end, I think my friend was right. While at first glance there appear to be many uses and benefits, I don't think these benefits are as substantial as they are flashy. There are also downsides to multiple monitors, which aren't often talked about. They are slight enough that I easily overlooked them for years, but my tolerance declines as the years go by.


## Caveats:

- I have never tried a portrait oriented secondary monitor. Some people like it, but I personally don't see the point- all monitors today are wide, and web design heavily targets portrait mobile devices. You can just arrange windows side by side without the need for a separate monitor in a wonky orientation- you don't HAVE to maximize windows and waste horizontal space. If you think I've overlooked something here, please let me know. I'm curious!
- I do not frequently edit video or audio. I imagine having an excessively wide workspace is very useful in programs like that, where the workflow centers around horizontal timelines. That being said, I'd argue an ultrawide monitor is the better choice here.
- I might as well say this right off the bat- I intend to supplement my PC experience with a spare laptop and KVM switch for keyboard/mouse. As I'll explain later, this lets me retain some of the benefits while avoiding most of the problems.
- If I don't address your use case below, I didn't think of it and it doesn't apply to me. Keep in mind I'm writing about my experiences!


## Operating System Support

You know what was great? Windows 8. No longer present in 10 is the `hot corners` feature, which effectively made the bottom left pixel into the Windows start button. On every monitor. This meant the `start screen` (also not fully present in 10) was not bound to the monitor with the `task bar`- it appeared on whichever display you happened to be using. Smart. My preferred `task bar` location is on the leftmost monitor, on the left edge. I don't want one for each monitor, and I don't like to waste my vertical space: there's plenty of horizontal space to go around, especially with three monitors.

All of this is missing from 10. Good ideas, just thrown away! And without these conveniences, multiple monitors on 10 _suuucks_ to use, now that I know what I'm missing. It was hard to unlearn that bottom-left corner muscle memory, and it's stupid that I can only access the `start menu` on my left monitor now. **Multi monitor is a niche feature, and operating system support largely an afterthought**. Windows 10 has a setting for which edge you prefer the taskbar to be on, but no consideration is made for which monitor (unless you want them on all monitors). Fun fact: I like `Remote Desktop` and often use it to access my multi monitor PC. Every time I do, the `task bar` ends up being moved onto the center monitor- I must reposition my `task bar` almost every single time I sit down at my computer.

For a while, I thought `nVidia Surround` might solve a couple of the quirks I have with 10's multi monitor support. For those who don't know, `NV Surround` is a feature that presents all monitors to Windows 10 as one single ultrawide monitor. This approach solves some problems, while introducing many more. It becomes very evident that Windows has no considerations for ultrawide resolutions **at all**. If ultrawide resolutions become popular in the consumer market, I imagine this will change, but for the moment I found the window management tools Windows has today near unusable with that much width. Luckily there are some 3rd party programs we can turn to. In the days of XP I used `nVidia nView`, which may have been perfect. Unfortunately, today that feature seems to have been made exclusive to `nVidia quadro` GPUs. I happen own a copy of <https://www.displayfusion.com/> which sports similar features. Unfortunately, it's buggy. I won't go into depth, but I found it unreliable and frustrating. I think the answer to this problem needs to come directly from Microsoft itself.

I should mention, Linux support for multiple monitors is pretty OK. I use `dwm`, which also has "pretty OK" support, but largely the tagging system just reminds me how redundant extra monitors are. Which brings me to my next point: multiple monitors encourages inefficient workflows and use of space.


## Promoting Inefficiency

This isn't necessarily a terrible thing. You can be efficient on one monitor, or inefficient across multiple monitors. It doesn't matter which you choose, but it does make it hard to justify spending money on extra unnecessary monitors. It takes some effort, but optimizing a single screen setup is energy well spent- and your efforts will translate to laptop usage as well. I place a large part of the blame on the traditional windowing workflow: it just doesn't make efficient use of space and it often requires a lot of micromanagement on the user's part. I'm a big fan of the "tiling window manager" `dwm` and its tagging system, but this sadly just doesn't exist on Windows. 10's multiple desktop and window snapping features are a step in the right direction, but really only plaster over the issue instead of properly solving it. Let me know if any of you have creative solutions for Windows! Until then, I'll just be doing the best I can with whatever 10 natively offers.


## Gaming Concerns

GPU usage
games suck at alt tab and minimize
overlays introduce issues
synergy quirks (maybe doesnt belong)

## Laptop / Continuum

Why this works:
- gaming concerns
- OS support (kvm)
- independently uninterrupted functionality
