When I first started this game, I hated every character and loved the combat. I thought the story was incredibly stupid and I was kind of surprised a game like this even had a story. It’s the kind of game where every female character looks like they just came out of a 14 year old boy’s wet dream. Ayumi isn’t even the worst offender of this!

Shockingly enough, the characters evolved such that I actually _liked_ them- each main character received enough characterization to become real, likeable, **people**, rather than the walking video game cliches they look like (ridiculously musclebound men, ridiculously over sexualized women). This astounded me; I was not expecting to have anything but contempt for the game’s seemingly pathetic attempt at story. The main plot, too, evolves into something worthwhile. The biggest problem this game has is probably the fact that the story and characters are overwhelmingly generic for the first half of the game…. but it does metamorphose into something unique towards the end. Well, the characters do; the story is largely generic still but there are several key plot points that separate it from the rest.

Unfortunately what did not evolve over time was the combat. As far as I know there are no combos to learn besides the very limited set you start out with. One of the combos brings you up into the air as you swing your sword about wildly, **but there are never ever any enemies that will be in the air with you**. What ends up happening is a lengthy animation of you swinging your sword in the air for 5 seconds while all the enemies wait for you to return to the ground. This happens automatically when you jump and attack- so if you need to jump over to an enemy _quickly_ and attack him, unless you’re very careful you might accidentally start that useless combo and it will prevent you from doing time sensitive things (there is no way to stop once started). I feel like I missed out on a mechanic or two though- you can lock onto enemies and dash at them, but 90% of the time the game bugs out and the dash is in slow motion and you never even reach the enemy. Then I read something about hanging from enemies in midair and hitting them with your sword. Huh. The most I was ever able to do was slide off them like they were covered in motor oil. You gain the ability to use fire, ice and generic projectiles very early on and then (with one exception) from there on out, all upgrades are minor and passive (for example, you might gain the ability to do more damage by using fire on someone who is frozen. No expanded gameplay, just ways to optimize damage). I started out really loving the combat, but it gets very old very fast. And it’s very buggy. The entire game is buggy actually. Luckily you can usually fix everything by reloading the last checkpoint, but if your checkpoint is before a particularly challenging battle, that can be frustrating.

Another major problem with this game is there are too many different mechanics. It feels like I’m playing a very long demo of hundreds of different games. Yes, the combat is boring, but constantly changing the rules of the world is not the way to fix that. At one point you gain wings and can fly, and I don’t even think it is explained… then you lose your wings shortly after, also unexplained. I found out by jumping off a cliff and falling to my death. At one point you are given a gun which you are required to use; if you kill the enemies without the gun, they keep regenerating indefinitely, and this is not explained. It was pretty obvious I had to use the gun to kill them, but I couldn’t quite figure out how, and I couldn’t proceed by killing them normally. The biggest problem was the stupid jump combo- you had to freeze the enemy with the gun, then drop the gun and hit them before they thawed, except I would always activate that useless combo and never get to them in time.
The time rewind itself is also problematic and the ability is not explained at all. You are told that you have it, then you need to figure out how it works, which is a process that will take the rest of the game. But the game arbitrarily changes the way it works and often doesn’t even let you use it! How can you learn to use it if it keeps alternating between different rule sets and often isn’t even available to use? What I _think_ happens with the standard set of rules is; any time-clones of you will disappear if the main you alters enough variables in the past. So if you go back in time and get an enemy to follow the current you instead of the past you, the past you just disappears. Which is a problem because most of the time the point of time rewind is to distract enemies- but they mostly seem interested in **you**, not your past clones, which makes them all vanish, which makes the game frustrating. OK, so I understand that, I’ll try to use it against this boss now that I’m a little better with it. Oh wait, you can’t. Why? Because. Time rewind is not available to you for nearly _every single boss_. Then, some of the larger enemies require that you use it, but the way it works is completely different for those enemies. In one case- there’s a quick time event which you need to do twice at the same time. Cool right? Not really. You do it once, you rewind time and if you don’t press the button **immediately**, you lost your shot at it and you need to spend 5 more minutes weakening the enemy again. To reiterate- you can’t just go back in time and wait for the opportunity to use the quick time event going forward in time, you have to hit the quick time event whilst going backwards in time.. because for some reason your clone disappears in this particular context (you can’t make time rewind clones). Then, on the giant worm boss, you can make time rewind clones but the moment you do the boss just retreats, changing variables and erasing all your clones immediately. The logistics of this time rewind thing is complicated enough without all the arbitrary exceptions and changes.

I can’t decide if I like this game or not. On the one hand, there are unique game play and story elements that are definitely worth experiencing, because there is nothing else like it. On the other hand, the game doesn’t respect itself enough to expand upon the more interesting elements and instead chooses to try 100 different things, which all collapse into one incoherent mess of a game. I suppose I recommend this game only because the length is short enough that you can actually complete it before being fed up with its many issues, and I think it is worth at least $10, so pick it up in the next sale.
