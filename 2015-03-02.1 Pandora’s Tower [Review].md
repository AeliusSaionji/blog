I don't often review games because most of them may be fun, but aren't really noteworthy in either gameplay or artistic ideas. Most western games feel like, "hey we came up with a gameplay mechanic we think is neat, and we hired some writers to give us a story that we thought was pretty good". Most Eastern games can be summarized as, "young kids are (for some contrived reason) the only ones who can save the nation/world/galaxy/universe! Watch as they go through the generic eastern coming of age story!" That's not to say these games aren't _fun_, but I am always looking for something that takes into account the story is _played_, not watched or read. Most games' stories fail to realize that games offer an entirely new literary technique that has (to my knowledge) never existed before the digital age. Most games fail to realize that limiting a game to what is strictly "fun" is a terrible practice. That's like saying all movies should be happy; no sad movies should exist. A game's narrative can explore terrible, terrible things, and be gripping and compelling without ever being "fun".

Ok, enough beating around the bush with this pretentious speak, how was Pandoras's Tower!?

Well, it could certainly be better, and it would have benefited from a larger budget and also **not being on the Wii** (the graphics look like ass and almost all non character textures look like they're less than 8 bits, it's very obvious that the game kept running into issues with the Wii's limited memory and processing power).

However, it offers an amazing experience with a story enhanced by gameplay elements. I love this game.

Pandora's Tower has a gripping story that focuses around the girl named Elena (or Ceres in the Japanese release). She's cursed and you, her boyfriend, must risk life and limb to find "beast flesh" that will reverse the progress of the curse. When you leave her alone, the curse will slowly transform her into a hideous beast. Any flesh you find will reverse the effects of the curse, but only after consuming the "Master Flesh" of each of the game's bosses can the curse be permanently lifted.

The game has a time mechanic; go dungeon crawling for too long and she starts to transform. There is a window of time in which you can be gone where she will not transform at all. If you don't get back to her in a reasonable amount of time with her fix, terrible things happen. Don't fear though, the time mechanic is not harsh, and the explorable sections of the towers aren't actually very big anyway. In fact, the game spends a lot of its time making the player sincerely feel for Elena, and it works- at least, it worked on me. I was constantly watching that timer because if she starts turning, she becomes depressed and downtrodden. Seeing her like that made **me** depressed. After a while she crawls into the basement and huddles in a corner... how can you not feel for her? She is also generally depressed not because of the curse, but because her lover must risk his life on her behalf. Not helping is the truly repulsive flesh she must eat in large quantities.... Remember how I said games don't have to be fun to be good? This is an example. I won't go into more detail, but suffice it to say the characterization is depressingly excellent.

I mentioned the timer which effectively monitors her transformation; a gameplay mechanic that enhances the story in that I choose to return to her much earlier than necessary because I don't want her to suffer. There is another example of that in this game: crafting presents for her. I suppose I should throw up a spoiler warning here, because I am a firm believer that it is these little details that make the game. If you're interested in playing and don't want spoilers, stop reading and go play it. OK? OK. Well, at least skip this following paragraph.
I found myself scouring the towers for specific items just to create gifts to give to Elena. It increases her love for you (more on that later), and also it provides further characterization through her responses. Most significantly though, wearable gifts like a bracelet will break if you allow her to transform. She will cry- terribly upset she broke the gift you gave her. I felt entirely responsible every time, I felt it was my fault for not returning to her sooner; and now she's blaming herself for this on top of everything else. Such moments deeply affected me, and I made a point of never letting the timer go so low again. See how gameplay mechanics can enhance the story for a better experience? You rarely find examples of this in most AAA games...

The rest of the gameplay I found unique and refreshing. There are a number of ways to kill enemies, the game takes its time in showing you how to use the different abilities so I never felt overwhelmed or forgot how to do something. You have a sword (or other type weapon) with which you can perform some combos, and you also wield a chain that is dual purpose weapon and grappling hook. You can latch onto enemies and lacerate the flesh off of them, whip the chain and bash smaller enemies against the floor, shoot the chain at enemies, swing enemies around which hurts any enemy in radius... You can even tie to enemies together and laugh while they bumble around. You can chain enemies to a wall and have them stay put for a while, to my endless delight. Larger enemies can be chained on different parts of their body; chain their feet together and they fall over... Unique, awesome, and fun. Using it as a grappling hook was good fun too. The difficulty curve is incredibly forgiving, but towards the end it did finally ramp up a bit. There isn't much I want to talk about here except for boss battles and level design. All the levels are simple enough that I was never really stumped until the last tower, but the puzzles weren't _patronizingly_ simple. It was a perfect balance of thought provoking, but not so challenging that I was ever in danger of running out of time (before Elena turns into a beast). The puzzles involve a lot of navigating and remembering which room is where; if you don't have a good memory you will be using the map a lot.
The bosses were also puzzle based; you need to find ways to make them expose their "Master Flesh" as the only way to kill them is to rip out said flesh; no generic hack and slash here. None of the bosses were particularly challenging in my opinion, and the only heart pumping crazy intense fights were the last two bosses. The music scores during all the boss fights are awesome and epic and just fit with the theme of the game really really well, too.

A large part of the game is kind of a simplistic dating simulator. You give Elena gifts and you talk to her. The more you do, the more she loves you, which determines what ending you get. If you let her turn into a beast, she becomes depressed and withdrawn and her love for you will decrease, just in case you needed any more motivation to be timely in giving her flesh. I actually thoroughly enjoyed this aspect of the game, and I easily exhausted nearly all her responses about halfway through the game. I really wish they added more dialog for her... despite the fact that I exhausted all responses, I would always talk with her; otherwise I would feel bad if I didn't spend time with her when I was home. She sings frequently in the beginning of the game (a beautiful song that is thematically reminiscent of much of the game's intense music, used to great effect during the final boss fight), prompting more unique dialog afterwards. She stops singing to mark her descent into depression, but I found the lack of it detracted from the overall experience as it is replaced by nothing. She cleans the house and looks at flowers. Singing was a randomly occurring treat, but once it's gone.... Furthermore, there were only ~7 unique gifts you can give her. Two of them are bracelets and for some reason she can only wear one at a time. I really wish there were more clothes and accessories you could give her to wear. No, I do not have a life. There were a lot of little details I loved; she would run over to you and exclaim, "Welcome back!" or, "I'm so glad you're safe" when you walked in the door to the house. When talking to her, you would occasionally be given the option to tell her about your adventures, and her reactions are priceless, like when I told her I swung over a pit of lava she gasped and exclaimed, "WHAAAAT?! ARE YOU SURE THERE WASN'T ANOTHER WAY ACROSS!?". This humorous interaction also puts a little perspective on the things you're doing; normally this kind of action in games is generic hero work and you think nothing of it. Elena reminds the player that, in the context of the world, what you are doing is dangerous and extraordinary; all for her. It's nice that some of your hard work gets to be appreciated. Normally in games, no matter what horror you face, silent protagonist or not, **no one knows or cares about your various encounters**, unless it happens to be a major plot point.

Time to discuss the multiple endings. Well, I'm only going to talk about the bad ones, and I'm not going to spoil anything. The endings are S-D, S being the one you get when she loves you a lot, A being the one you get when she loves you slightly less, and so on. Endings S and A and really good. The rest of them are so bad I'm currently working on erasing them from my memory. Seriously; I don't care how curious you are, make sure you get either S or A, and do not watch the lower ones on YouTube or where ever. The bad endings don't make logical sense, they contradict the established story and character traits. Seems like they were just randomly made up to make use of the love/affection mechanic you had to work for throughout the game.

The English voice acting was terrible, as is usually the case with dubs. I actually played the game "undubbed" which means I took the Japanese audio from the Japanese release and inserted it into the European release of the game. Thus, I had the Japanese voice actors (who were AWESOME) and English subtitles so I could still tell what was going on. I highly recommend this- I saw some of the cutscenes with the English voice actors and I just could not take them seriously. It kills the experience.

Final thoughts: I loved this game, and despite the fact that the 'dating' mechanics felt a little barren, they were still incredibly effective in getting me to become emotionally invested in Elena's well being. Great attention to detail was given to Elena's facial expressions, mannerisms and posture and I really loved to see her smile, and hated to see her in pain. Despite the fact that ending S might not have been as strong as ending A, those endings were each beautiful in their own right and provided a fantastic end to a fantastic game.

A word of technical advice: since the game seems to be more than the Wii could handle, the game has been graphically scaled back significantly to run smoothly on the Wii. There is a significant aliasing problem. If you have a computer powerful enough, I highly recommend playing this game in an emulator, increasing the game's resolution to at least 3x the native resolution. The game will look 1000x times better at a higher resolution, and the aliasing will be significantly reduced.

## SPOILERS BELOW

I want to talk about the shortcomings of the story, particularly ending S. As the game progresses and you feed Elena more and more flesh, she eventually starts craving it. Ending S is basically, the curse is lifted, you live happily ever after. Uhh... what about her unhealthy and rather violent addiction to flesh? No mention is made of that. Sure you could argue that once the curse was lifted and possession exorcised, so was her lust for flesh, but I don't buy that. Elena was the one who was lusting for flesh, not the person possessing her. Still it was a nice happy ending that rounded off the game and story well. What didn't do the game any favors was the entire bit of dialog that played during the credits, which started explaining every little thing about the curse and so on... That was just kind of dumb. Less is more, people. While I'm pointing out dumb things, why are the Japanese so obsessed with past lives and reincarnation, and the tired old trope "evil people are just good people driven to do bad things by extenuating circumstances"? How about, sometimes the evil person is just evil because they're a dick? Just _once_ I'd like to play a game from Japan that didn't try to justify the villain's actions, or detail a pitiable descent from good to evil. Reincarnation and the good-turned-evil tropes are part of this plot, but they could have easily been left out and the story would have been **SIGNIFICANTLY** better without them.
