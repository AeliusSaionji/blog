I don't often review games; most are fun, but not particularly noteworthy in gameplay or artistic ideas. The average western game feels like it's all about the play and the story is an afterthought. Many Eastern games can be summarized as, "young kids are (for some contrived reason) the only ones who can save the nation/world/galaxy/universe! Watch as they go through the generic eastern coming of age story!" That's not to say these games aren't _fun_, but I am always looking for games which both value their narrative and take into account the story is _played_, not watched or read. Games offer an entirely new literary technique that has (to my knowledge) never existed before the digital age, and the gaming industry does not capitalize on this nearly enough. Moreover, many games limit themselves to that which is 'fun'. Movies are free to explore emotions other than "happy" and "uplifting"- why should games be so narrowly focused on "fun"? A game's narrative can explore terrible, terrible things, and be gripping and compelling without ever being "fun".

Ok, enough beating around the bush with this pretentious speak, how was Pandoras's Tower!?

Well, it could certainly be better, and it would have benefited from a larger budget and also **not being on the Wii**. The graphics look like ass, and almost all non-character textures look like they're less than 8 bits: the visuals were clearly cut down to accommodate the Wii's limited memory and processing power.

However, it offers an amazing experience, with a narrative enhanced by gameplay elements. I love this game.

## Plot, Synopsis, and the Marriage of Mechanics and Narrative

The story focuses around a girl named Elena (Ceres in the Japanese release), the victim of a curse which disfigures her body, transforming her into a lovecraftian horror. Yes, this is your classic 'damsel in distress' story- don't expect anything socially progressive. You play as Aeron (or Ende), and you risk life and limb to find "beast flesh" that will reverse the progress of Elena's curse. The flesh just provides temporary relief, however: only by consuming special "Master Flesh" can her curse be permanently lifted.

Central to the gameplay is a time mechanic: while you're out dungeon crawling, Elena is suffering the effects of the curse. Wait too long to bring her back some flesh and terrible things happen. Don't fear though, the time mechanic is not harsh, and the explorable sections of the towers aren't actually very big. The game spends a lot of its time making the player sincerely feel for Elena, and it works- at least, it worked on me. Rather than seeing the curse timer as a leash, I was carefully watching it, diligently returning home frequently with flesh, eager to keep Elena's spirit from falling. If Elena starts turning, she becomes depressed and downtrodden, and seeing her like that made **me** depressed! After a time, she crawls into the basement and huddles in a corner... how can you not feel for her? She's not depressed only because of her curse, either- she repeatedly expresses concern for you, frustrated that she cannot help, frustrated that you are risking your life on her behalf, often saying it would be better if she just died so she would stop being such a burden. Not helping is the truly repulsive flesh she must eat in large quantities.... Remember how I said games don't have to be fun to be good? This is an example. I won't go into more detail, but suffice it to say the characterization is depressingly excellent.

I want to highlight how the curse timer is put to clever use as a gameplay mechanic that actually enhances the narrative: I choose to return to Elena much earlier than necessary because I don't want her to suffer. The union of story and gameplay creates something which is greater than the sum of its parts. There is another example of that in this game: crafting presents. I suppose I should throw up a spoiler warning here, because I am a firm believer that these little details make the game. If you're interested in playing, skip the rest of this paragraph. I found myself scouring the towers for specific items just to create gifts for Elena. Gifts increase her love for you, and also provides further characterization through her responses. Most significantly though, wearable gifts like a bracelet will break if you allow her to transform. She will cry- terribly upset she broke the gift you gave her. I felt entirely responsible every time, I felt it was my fault for not returning to her sooner; and now she's blaming herself for this on top of everything else! Such moments deeply affected me, and I made a point of never letting the timer sink so low again. Again, gameplay mechanics, if used effectively, can enhance the story for a better experience.

## Gameplay Loop Overview

The rest of the gameplay I found unique and refreshing. There are a number of ways to kill enemies and the game takes its time in showing you how to use the different abilities; I never felt overwhelmed or forgot how to do something. You have a sword with which you can perform some combos, and you also wield a chain that is dual purpose weapon and grappling hook. The chain can do many things: latch onto enemies to lacerate their flesh off, bash smaller enemies against the floor, swing enemies around, hurting other enemies within range. You can even tie to enemies together and laugh while they bumble around, or chain enemies to a wall and have them stay put for a while. Larger enemies can be chained on different parts of their body; chain their feet together and they fall over. You navigate through most areas by grappling onto various perches and swinging around. All of this is unique, awesome, and fun. The difficulty curve is incredibly forgiving, but towards the end it did finally ramp up a bit. There isn't much I want to talk about here except for boss battles and level design. All the levels are simple enough that I was never really stumped until the last tower, but the puzzles weren't _patronizingly_ simple. It was a perfect balance of thought provoking, but not so challenging that I was ever in danger of running out of time. The puzzles involve a lot of navigating and remembering which room is where; if you don't have a good memory (like me) you will be using the map a lot.

The bosses are puzzle based; you need to find ways to make them expose their "Master Flesh" as the only way to kill them is to rip out said flesh- no generic hack and slash here. None of the bosses were particularly challenging in my opinion, the only heart-pumping, intense fights were the last two bosses. The music played during boss encounters are epic as well- particularly during the final boss fight.

A large part of the game is kind of a simplistic dating simulator. You give Elena gifts and you talk to her- how often you do this determines which ending you'll get. I actually thoroughly enjoyed this aspect of the game, and I easily exhausted nearly all her responses about halfway through the game (I wish there were more). I continued to talk to her anyway, because I'd feel guilty if I just ignored her. Here's another minor spoiler warning! Skip these next two paragraphs if you don't want to hear about some of the little details that make the experience. Elena sings frequently in the beginning of the game, prompting more unique dialog afterward. She will eventually stop singing as she descends into depression. Narratively this works, but she doesn't do much else, and the sudden lack of her singing detracted from the overall experience, as it is replaced by nothing. Singing is a randomly occurring treat, but once it's gone, you lose a deviation from the normal gameplay loop. As a result, the latter parts of the "dating sim" tend to be rather uneventful and same-y. Not helping at all- there are only ~7 unique gifts you can give her. Two of them are bracelets, and for some reason she can only wear one at a time- although I'm in no position to criticize someone's fashion sense so I can't harp on that too much. However I do really wish there were more clothes and accessories you could give to her. No, I do not have a life.

There were a lot of little details I loved about the "dating sim"; when returning home, she sometimes runs over to you and exclaims, "Welcome back!" or, "I'm so glad you're safe". When talking to her, you will occasionally be given the option to tell her about your adventures, and her reactions are priceless. Once, I told her I swung over a pit of lava; she gasped and exclaimed, "WHAAAAT?! ARE YOU SURE THERE WASN'T ANOTHER WAY ACROSS!?". This humorous interaction also puts some perspective on the things you're doing: normally this kind of action in games is generic hero work; you think nothing of it. Elena reminds the player that, in the context of this fantasy, what you are doing is dangerous and extraordinary; and it's all for her. It's nice that some of your hard work gets to be appreciated. I don't think I've ever seen this acknowledged in any other game: no matter what horror you face, silent protagonist or not, **no one knows or cares about your various encounters** (unless it happens to be a major plot point).

## Endings and Closing Thoughts

Time to discuss the multiple endings. Well, I'm only going to talk about the bad ones, and I'm not going to spoil anything. The endings are ranked from `S` through `D`. Endings S and A are great. The rest of them are so bad I'm currently working on erasing them from my memory. Seriously; I don't care how curious you are, make sure you get either `S` or `A`, and do not watch the lower ones on YouTube or where ever. The bad endings don't make logical sense, and they contradict the established story and character traits. Seems like they were just randomly made up to make use of the love/affection mechanic you had to work for throughout the game.

The English voice acting was terrible, as is usually the case with dubs. I played the game "undubbed" which means I took the Japanese audio from the Japanese release and inserted it into the European release of the game. Thus, I had the Japanese voice actors (who were _awesome_) with English subtitles. I highly recommend this- I saw some of the cutscenes featuring the English voice actors, and I just could not take them seriously. I think it kills the experience.

Final thoughts: I loved this game, and despite the slightly lacking "dating" mechanics, it was still incredibly effective in making me emotionally invested in Elena's well being. Great attention to detail was given to Elena's facial expressions, mannerisms and posture; I loved to see her smile, and hated to see her in pain. Although I felt ending `S` was not as strong as ending `A`, both endings were each beautiful in their own right, and each provide a fantastic end to a fantastic game.

A word of technical advice: the game is largely more than the Wii can handle, and has been graphically scaled back significantly. The level of aliasing is beyond sad, and the art design just does allow for clear visuals at the Wii's `480p` resolution. If you have a computer powerful enough, I highly recommend playing this game in an emulator, increasing the game's resolution to at least 3x the native resolution. The game will look 1000x times better, and the aliasing will be significantly reduced.

## SPOILERS BELOW

I want to talk about the shortcomings of the story, particularly ending S. As the game progresses and you feed Elena more and more flesh, she eventually starts craving it. Ending S in a nutshell: the curse is lifted, you live happily ever after. Uhh... what about her unhealthy and rather violent addiction to flesh? No mention is made of that. Sure, you could argue that once the curse was lifted and possession exorcised, so too was her lust for flesh. But I don't buy that. Elena was the one who was lusting for flesh, I thought that was clear. Still, it was a nice happy ending that you perhaps aren't meant to examine too closely.

What didn't do the game any favors was the dialog that played during the credits, which started explaining every little detail about the curse and the events leading up to the story: that was just kind of dumb. Less is more! I won't get into it, but I also dislike the Eastern focus on past lives and reincarnation, and the tired old trope "evil people are just good people driven to do bad things by extenuating circumstances"? How about, sometimes the evil person is just evil because they're a dick? Just _once_ I'd like to play a game from Japan that didn't try to justify the villain's actions, or detail a pitiable descent from good to evil. Reincarnation and the good-turned-evil tropes are part of this plot, but they could have easily been left out and the story would have been **SIGNIFICANTLY** better without them.
