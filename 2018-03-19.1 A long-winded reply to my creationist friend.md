# A long-winded reply to my creationist friend

I think it would be helpful to clearly delineate what science is, and what it is not.

Science is not a competing ideology to religion. Science is best thought of as a process. The following is a loose description of the process:

- A researcher want to know how something works
- The researcher creates a hypothesis (aka a falsifiable guess)
- The researcher tries to disprove their own hypothesis by a clearly documented experiment or body of evidence
- The researcher submits their work for peer review, in which scientists around the world determine if sound methodology was used in trying to disprove the hypothesis
- Scientists around the world repeat the researcher's documented experiment and see if they get the same results

If a hypothesis is disproved, that is still valuable. Knowing the ways in which an idea is disproved is valuable information moving forward. Even if someone goes through all of the above with the hypothesis intact, the findings are still not taken as fact. We want to see other scientists redo the same work (aka replicate the findings). We want to see it used as the foundation for new work. The ultimate goal is to understand the world around us. It is only by this process of careful iterative vetting, of discovering what is true and what is not true, that humans have created computers. An electrical grid which powers our computers. A vast infrastructure to connect all computers together. Vaccines. Antibiotics. Spaceships. Airplanes.

We didn't make computers without being pretty damn familiar with electricity. We didn't make air force bomber jets without knowing a hell of a lot about aerodynamics and propulsion. We didn't design antibiotics without knowing how evolution works.

Our understanding of living creatures is not provided by "foaming at the mouth atheists" spending their days trying to disprove God. We have observed the fossil record of ancient creatures, we have observed living creatures, we have observed microorganisms and bacteria. Using what we learned from these observations, we created medicines to combat bacterial disease. It's unfortunate that many religious people have taken personal offense to the model. But the model, well, "models" all life accurately, and the model has not been falsified. Only when we are absolutely certain of a hypothesis do we graduate it to a "Theory" (ie, working model which is the foundation for newer hypotheses). Evolution is a Theory. Note that scientists use the word Theory differently from the colloquial sense of the word. Colloquially we use "theory" to mean something like what scientists would call a hypothesis. It's like how "incompetent" has a distinctive meaning in law different from common parlance.

That's not to say a Theory is guaranteed fact. The scientific process is about better understanding the world. If a better model comes along, that model will replace the Theory of Evolution. This is unlikely. Why? Because we build knowledge like laying bricks to build a wall. If someone wanted to challenge our understanding of how electricity works, they would have the extraordinary burden of 1.) Providing a falsifiable hypothesis which 2.) Simultaneously explains why the current understanding is inaccurate AND also somehow explains how we managed to build computers without understanding the fundamental workings of the parts involved.
It'd be like if someone told you that your childhood memories are false. You would require a lot of information to be convinced: why do I have this scar if the memory of getting the scar isn't real? If my mother isn't real, who did I talk to this morning? How did I get my basic high school education if I didn't go to school? And so on. An extraordinary amount of evidence would be required to overturn your current understanding of your life.

So it goes for evolution. The mystery as to how we created a significant chunk of modern medicine with an inaccurate understanding of the subject matter would need to be explained. This is no small barrier.

Aside: there's a lot of bad science and bad science reporting, and bad science reporters report bad science. If you don't know how to detect that, it can be overwhelming and easy to dismiss the entire affair. Just remember: one study alone doesn't prove anything. Systematic reviews of multiple similar studies and replication studies are what matter. So when the news is talking about "a new study" and it doesn't mention corroborating studies, peer review, if it has been replicated, or if this is a "systematic" or "meta study", then you can probably just ignore the findings. A single unfalsified study is an interesting and plausible idea, but it is far from accepted fact.


> The problem that Dawkins faces is:  Who designed the "single, simple sheet of light sensitive cells?"

Those evolved too, of course. We don't have a complete record of the history of every step taken in every creature's evolutionary path, but I'm sure with some research you might find more information about how certain cells may have become light sensitive. Anticipating the question "who designed the first cells?", there's actually a very interesting hypothesis for this. Some basic chemical compounds that would have been present on early Earth have the same shape as a simple cell. Over the course of hundreds of thousands of years, these naturally occurring compounds integrated together in such a way that they advanced from simple chemical interactions to a more complicated system. The rest is history! As a person of faith you might say that God designed the universe such that it was inevitable that this process would occur and humans would eventually come about. No one could argue against that.


> Which idea really requires more faith?

This is a fair point, but perhaps not in the way you intended it to be. The scientific method pivots on one single point of faith: a faith in our human senses, the faith that our senses are not fundamentally deceiving us. That is the beginning and the end of faith's role in science. We can use what we see, hear, smell, etc, to accurately probe the world around us.

In the context of creationism vs evolution;

- The Theory of Evolution is built on a body of evidence, and is in turn built upon in a way that literally created and sustains our healthy modern "first world" society.
- Creationism is built on
  - Faith
  - A belief in a global conspiracy in which generations of scientists have perfectly crafted a body of evidence to perpetuate a lie to the public, all for unknown reasons.... Or God/Satan have created "false evidence" to test our Faith in [our contemporary interpretation of] one single specific biblical assertion. And that "false evidence" also works as the foundation for medicines, so falling for the "bait" (so to speak) results in better health and prosperity.

Hmm. I think a loving God would want us to develop better medicine, don't you?


It is important to note that Science and Religion are not at war with each other. That would imply intentionality and an agenda. Science has no agenda. It's unfortunate that careful study has resulted in findings which conflict with a certain world-view as presented by the Church, but history is littered with examples of the Church violently opposing certain findings we accept as fact today. Back when the Church wielded great governing power, it was **known**[1] that the Bible said, clearly and unambiguously, that the Earth was the center of the universe and the Sun travels around the Earth. Astronomers eventually came to the conclusion that this was not true, and they published the Heliocentric (sun-centric) theory of the solar system. In response, the Church labeled such scientists heretics and punished them as they saw fit.

Today, it is **known**[2] that of course the Bible was misinterpreted, the Bible never actually promoted a Geocentric (Earth-centric) solar system!

I suspect that soon it will be "known" that, of course the Bible never actually promoted the idea of Creationism, everyone just misinterpreted it! I'm just glad the Church is (somewhat) less involved in governing affairs for this transition.


Given the Church's colorful history, you can see how I might be uneasy about taking the Bible as literal fact. It may very well be the word of God, but even so, it clearly is subject to very fallible human interpretation. Most religious people I know will readily tell me the Bible is metaphor, stories that guide us and give us inspiration. I think this is a more honest position to hold; it is inevitable that each person will take from the Bible their own personal meaning and unique inspirations. When you insist the Bible is literal fact, you inherently insist that your own personal interpretation of the Bible is literal fact. In doing so, you set yourself up to not only oppose the progression of knowledge on subjects which do not and can not challenge the existence of God, but you also put yourself at odds with other interpretations of biblical writings, isolating yourself from those who otherwise share in the same Faith.


I'd like to reiterate that Science is not at war with Religion. The existence of a God cannot be presented as a falsifiable hypothesis. I've used this term a few times, but let me explicitly define it here: there must be a condition by which a hypothesis can be proven false. Proof and Faith are mutually exclusive concepts. **By definition**, science can never disprove a God, and anyone who claims otherwise is irresponsible or misinformed. There are many Atheists who are certainly willing to try, but do not confuse those petty squabbles with real scientific work.
