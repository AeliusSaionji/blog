I had been loosely following the Insider preview of 10- not really using the OS, but keeping it up to date, looking at all the bugs, then turning it off again moments later. Having poked my head in every once and a while since the beginning of the Insider program, I had a rough idea of how buggy the system was and the pace at which development progressed. The release date of 10 seemed early. Very early. My original plan was to install 10 a month after launch, but ##windows@freenode thought it would be fine- I don’t know why I thought their guess about the quality of the launch version would be more accurate than mine. Come launch day, between my impatience to acclimate myself to the new OS and the reassurances of strangers on the internet that it would probably be fine, I went ahead and installed it on two of my devices. tl;dr I should have waited. It’s pretty buggy at the moment, several things have gotten worse and there’s not much improved over 8.1 to offset these two problems. The general impression I’m getting is that Windows10 a) regressed a lot of 8′s better (but unpopular) ideas so that b) more people would be willing to adopt and thus be on board with the new rolling release update system.

I won’t bore you with the various issues I had to work past to actually get 10 installed and activated. I’m not going to tell you about all the minor facets of the UI I dislike. I know that in due time I’ll get used to the new UI, and I don’t want to write anything for my smug future self to look back on patronizingly, “oh I used to think *that*? How quaint.” For those reasons I’m going to keep the UI complaints to a minimum.

* OneDrive integration is now “less confusing” to the average user, and also completely useless. Where previously you had file and folder sync granularity, now you are forced to choose entire folders to sync, from a UI that doesn’t tell you the contents of any folder. This will come at a huge disk space penalty, unless I reorganize and micromanage the folder structure. Adding and removing folders is no longer easy, it’s hidden in a menu with an arduous to use UI- select your folders from this expanding list using a small, unresizable parent box!
* Speaking of small, unresizable boxes and useful things made useless: the “All Apps” interface. The vocal Windows userbase has made it quite clear that familiarity is more important than improvements and any attempt to innovate will be met with fierce resistance- but on the other hand MS still needs to make the UI touch friendly. This outcome was inevitable. I hope you’re happy. The problem with familiarity here is that the Start Menu was never actually any good. It started out as an expanding multi-layered list, often expanding to cover the *cough* full screen. It was a labyrinth and you could lose several layers of navigation progress with one wrong movement of the cursor. Enter Vista: it’s easy to see that they were trying to solve the “whoops lost my place now I have to start over” issue of the earlier Start Menu (and also solve the issue of not being able to see everything on lower resolution displays). However, the way they chose to do this is unfortunate: by constraining a list that expands horizontally AND vertically in a small box that can’t be resized. Navigating means scrolling vertically and horizontally, and this usually meant tedious scroll-bar dragging. Luckily, Vista also introduced the ability to search start menu items, so we didn’t have to actually use the accursed interface, which remained unchanged in the next iteration of Windows: 7. Windows 8 changed the apps list to once again fill the screen, and have what is known as a “flat” folder display (no nesting). This is a clearly superior approach to all previous iterations of the Start Menu, but the implementation lacked a few necessary UI cues. Rather than offer constructive criticism to improve the new approach, the userbase collectively decided that they would rather continue with the crappy UI they were used to. To 10′s credit, they did get rid of horizontal scrolling, but if you have a nest more than one layer deep you won’t actually be able to read any given file name, and the big, touch friendly UI means you’ll be doing twice as much vertical scrolling to compensate for the lack of horizontal scrolling... which is why no one will ever use it, ever. Useless.
* Recimg.exe is gone and there doesn’t appear to be an equivalent replacement. On a related note, Reset in 10 doesn’t actually work right (at the time of writing). Windows.old is for some reason relied upon by system processes and so the Reset function creates a dirty, dirty incomplete install that parasitically feasts on the intestines of the previous install. To recap: Windows 10 got rid of/broke the excellent Refresh and Reset features 8 introduced. Brilliant!
* I use the desktop slideshow feature. I enjoyed rotating my wallpapers every 3 minutes. Arbitrary limitation #1: Windows 10 only gives you intervals of 1 minute and 10 minutes. I hope this is a binary pun and they’re going to restore the other options soon. Whatever happened to just typing the number of minutes you wanted? Gah, computers and phones get dumber every year.
* Speaking of the desktop slideshow, every time the wallpaper changes, on both of the PCs I put 10 on, my input freezes. My mouse and keyboard become unresponsive for a second or so while the pretty wallpaper transition occurs.
* Another random bug: you can hit Ctrl+Shift+Enter to launch any given program as Administrator from the Start Menu. Just not regedit.exe.
* Arbitrary limitation #2: what happened to my Win+F file search keyboard shortcut?
* The start menu is resizable. Hey, that’s pretty neat! Arbitrary limitation #3: you can’t resize it to fill the screen. I can’t understand this logic.
* The touch keyboard is now harder to hide: previously, the popup menu had a “hide keyboard” option that was directly under your finger when the menu popped up, so you could double tap an area to hide the keyboard. Now it’s gone, so you have to precision tap the tiny X close button.

* But wait, there’s a fullscreen setting! Still though, why wouldn’t you just let us resize it to fill the screen? Why the hidden setting? Here’s why: the layout of the Start Menu changes slightly when fullscreen is enabled. What does it do with this extra screen real estate, you ask? It hides a bunch of useful things behind a hamburger menu. Because logic.
* This last gripe is extremely minor and I’ll probably have gotten over it by the time I publish this, but when the taskbar is in a vertical orientation, the various associated animations move across the screen excessively. *shrug* everyone has their own weird minor quirk.
* Arbitrary limitation #4: Virtual keyboard button can’t be moved and has been moved to the other side of the system tray, where you aren’t allowed to place toolbars. The excellent [http://www.lovesummertrue.com/touchmousepointer/en-us/index.html](http://www.lovesummertrue.com/touchmousepointer/en-us/index.html) now can no longer sit neatly next to the virtual keyboard icon.
* Arbitrary limitation #5: you can’t enroll a fingerprint without creating a pin code. Why is this, exactly?
* 10 removed the ‘run or raise’ logic from the start menu. That is, a program would be brought to the front if it were already running. If you wanted to run a new instance of the program, you had to shift+enter. Now it will always run a new instance.

* Last, I hope this is specific to my gaming rig, but project64 crashes 10 without so much as a BSOD! PC just reboots. Wonderful.

On top of that, explorer has generally felt bumpy and prone to microfreezes here and there. It reminds me of DPC latency issues, but it’s not that since it happens specifically as I interact with certain explorer elements. I hope they address the bugs soon. I do enjoy the new explorer (but FreeCommander is still better), the new start menu is OK all things told (but the “Apps List” can fuck right off), native FLAC and MKV support is nice but won’t stop me from installing all my usual 3rd party players (and no FLAC/MKV support on OneDrive; you can’t stream your library just yet). Windowed apps as opposed to fullscreen is great, but this feature was enabled by third party developers on 8 the other year. Tablet mode is a good start, but I don’t own or intend to own a tablet. I could keep going, but you can see why I’m not particularly impressed with 10: near every good change is tempered and not really ground breaking or worth upgrading my OS to get. I will say the new window managing approach is good enough where I’ll not need to install one of my usual 3rd party programs, the core calendar/mail/etc apps are a bit better than their 8 counterparts, and the Game integration feature is pretty neat.

## Update
Fixed the vast majority of microfreezes, turns out Windows Update was grabbing bad drivers that needed to be manually removed and replaced. I’m still having DPC latency issues, though. I’m also having issues with streaming to twitch.
